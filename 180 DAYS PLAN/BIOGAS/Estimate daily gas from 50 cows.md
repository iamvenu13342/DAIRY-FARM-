Here’s a practical sizing + cost estimate for a 50-cow dairy in India, with the math shown so you can tweak it.

## Step 1) Estimate daily gas from 50 cows

* **Dung per cow/day (India):** \~10–15 kg (local breeds), commonly used planning value = **10 kg/cow/day**. ([energy.vikaspedia.in][1], [ScienceDirect][2])
* **Biogas yield from fresh dung:** ≈ **0.04 m³/kg** (40 L per kg). ([bioenergyforumfact.org][3])

**Daily dung:** 50 × 10–15 kg = **500–750 kg/day**
**Daily biogas:** 500–750 × 0.04 = **20–30 m³/day**

### Recommended plant capacity

Choose a unit rated for **\~30 m³/day** (gives headroom in good seasons).

## Step 2) Digester volume (rule-of-thumb)

* Dilution: **1:1** (dung\:water), so slurry volume/day ≈ **0.5–0.75 m³/day** × 2 = **1.0–1.5 m³/day**.
* Hydraulic Retention Time (warm Indian climates): plan **\~30 days**.

**Working digester volume:** 30 × 1.0–1.5 ≈ **30–45 m³**
**Gas holder/storage:** \~25–50% of daily gas = **\~7–15 m³** (for cooking/boiler use smoothing).

> Summary spec for 50 cows: **30 m³/day biogas plant**, **\~40 m³ digester**, **\~10 m³ gasholder**, inlet mixing tank + slurry outlet pit.

## Step 3) What will it cost (₹)?

Costs vary by model (Deenbandhu/KVIC masonry vs. prefabricated), soil, piping distance, and whether you add purification or a genset. For simple thermal/cooking/heating use:

* **Global rule-of-thumb for basic biogas plants (unheated, no upgrading):** **USD \$50–\$75 per m³ of digester capacity** (civil + essentials, excl. land). That’s roughly **₹4,100–₹6,200 per m³** at \~₹83/USD. ([Energypedia][4])
* For a **\~40 m³ digester**, that’s **\~₹1.6–2.5 lakh** for core civil works. Add typical items (mixer, pipelines, gasholder dome, valves, simple H₂S/ moisture traps, commissioning, contractor fees), and real-world turnkey totals commonly land around:
  **≈ ₹2.5–5.0 lakh** for a **30 m³/day** farm-scale unit (no power generation, no CBG purification).

### Subsidy signal (can reduce out-of-pocket)

MNRE’s current Biogas Programme provides **Central Financial Assistance** for small plants (1–25 m³/day) and support/turnkey fees in that band; your 30 m³/day plant sits just above domestic range, but state schemes sometimes extend help around this size or split into multiple units. Check local PIA/state nodal agency for exact eligibility and amounts. ([Ministry of New and Renewable Energy][5], [biogas.mnre.gov.in][6])

### If you want to run a generator or make CBG

Power generation or CBG (bottled/vehicle fuel) needs gas cleaning, compression, and safety systems—costs jump by an order of magnitude (into **tens of lakhs to crores** depending on scale), as seen in recent municipal/gaushala projects (processing tonnes/day). That is **not** required for a 50-cow farm targeting thermal use. ([The Times of India][7])

## Quick takeaways for your 50-cow farm

* **Plant size:** **30 m³/day** biogas
* **Digester working volume:** **\~40 m³** (HRT \~30 days)
* **Budget (turnkey, cooking/boiler use):** **\~₹2.5–5.0 lakh** (location & spec dependent)
* **Fuel output:** **\~20–30 m³ gas/day**, enough for multiple biogas stoves, hot-water/boiler, or milk-parlour water heating. Inputs & yield based on Indian cattle dung and standard biogas yields. ([energy.vikaspedia.in][1], [bioenergyforumfact.org][3])

If you’d like, I can lay out a **bill of materials**, **piping layout**, and **daily O\&M plan** tailored to whether you’ll use the gas for **cooking**, **hot water**, or **milk-parlour heating**.
