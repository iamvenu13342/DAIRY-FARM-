<h1>🐄 Day 24: Design of Maternity Pens</h1>

---

## 1. Importance of Maternity Pens

* Provides a **safe, clean, and stress-free environment** for calving.
* Protects cow and calf from **injuries, infections, and stress**.
* Ensures farmer can easily assist during calving.
* Reduces cases of **calf mortality and postpartum diseases** (retained placenta, mastitis, uterine infections).

---

## 2. Size & Space Requirements

* **Recommended size:**

  * **12–15 m² per cow** (approx. 130–160 sq. ft.).
  * For large breeds (HF, Gir) → slightly bigger (15–18 m²).
* Height: **2.5–3 m roof clearance**.
* One maternity pen for every **20–25 cows** in the herd.

---

## 3. Floor Design

* Non-slippery, washable floor.
* **Dry, soft bedding** (straw, sawdust, or sand).
* Floor slope: **1:60** towards drain → easy cleaning.
* Avoid concrete-only floor → too hard, may injure cow/calf → use **rubber mats + bedding**.

---

## 4. Structure & Layout

* **Walls:** Half wall (3–4 ft) + open mesh above for ventilation.
* **Roof:** Asbestos/metal sheet with insulation or tiles.
* **Gate:** Wide gate for easy entry/exit of cow during calving.
* **Lighting:** At least **150 lux** for night calving monitoring.
* **Ventilation:** Ridge vent + open sides for airflow.

---

## 5. Facilities Inside Maternity Pen

* **Water trough** inside pen → cow should not need to leave during calving.
* **Manger (feed trough):** 0.6–0.75 m space.
* **Calving Kit Storage:** Disinfectants, clean ropes, towels, gloves, iodine for calf navel.
* **Emergency Access:** Space for vet or farmer to assist calving.

---

## 6. Management Practices

* Shift cow to maternity pen **2–3 weeks before expected calving**.
* Provide **extra nutrition** during late pregnancy.
* Keep pen **clean, dry, and disinfected**.
* After calving:

  * Clean calf’s nose & mouth → ensure breathing.
  * Dip calf’s navel in **tincture iodine**.
  * Provide cow with clean water and fodder immediately after calving.
  * Remove placenta & soiled bedding → disinfect pen before next use.

## 7. Best Practices for Andhra Pradesh

* Provide **good ventilation + fans/sprinklers** (summer heat stress).
* Use **locally available bedding** (paddy straw, groundnut haulm).
* Pens should be **close to cow shed** for easy monitoring.
* For a **50-cow farm** → at least **2 maternity pens** required.
