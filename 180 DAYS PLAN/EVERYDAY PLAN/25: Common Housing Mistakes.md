<H1>🐄 Day 25: Common Housing Mistakes</H1>

---

## 1. Poor Ventilation

* Mistake: Closed sheds without proper airflow.
* Effect: Heat stress, respiratory issues, reduced feed intake.
* Fix: Open-sided sheds, ridge vents, fans + sprinklers in hot weather.

---

## 2. Inadequate Space

* Mistake: Overcrowding (less than **10–12 m² per cow** in loose housing).
* Effect: Aggression, stress, disease spread, lower milk yield.
* Fix: Maintain recommended space → **35–40 sq. ft covered + 75–85 sq. ft open per cow**.

---

## 3. Wrong Shed Orientation

* Mistake: Shed built **North–South** → direct sunlight inside most of the day.
* Effect: Heat stress, discomfort.
* Fix: Build shed **East–West orientation** → minimum direct sun.

---

## 4. Poor Drainage

* Mistake: Flat floors or wrong slope.
* Effect: Stagnant urine & dung → foul smell, hoof diseases, mastitis risk.
* Fix: Floor slope **1:60 towards drains**, drains 10–15 cm wide, 7–10 cm deep.

---

## 5. Uncomfortable Flooring

* Mistake: Only concrete floor without bedding.
* Effect: Lameness, injuries, mastitis (hard, cold floor).
* Fix: Use **rubber mats, sand, or straw bedding** in resting area.

---

## 6. Inadequate Lighting

* Mistake: Dark sheds with poor visibility.
* Effect: Difficult heat detection, unsafe working conditions.
* Fix: Provide **16–18 hrs light/day**, 50–70 lux in sheds, 150–200 lux in parlours.

---

## 7. Poor Waste Management

* Mistake: Dung left inside shed, drains clogged.
* Effect: Fly/mosquito breeding, bad odor, diseases.
* Fix: Regular dung removal (2–3 times/day), use **biogas or manure pits**.

---

## 8. No Isolation/Sick Pens

* Mistake: Keeping sick or calving cows with herd.
* Effect: Disease spread, calf mortality, stress.
* Fix: Provide **sick pens + maternity pens** separately.

---

## 9. Inadequate Water & Feeding Facilities

* Mistake: Small water troughs, insufficient manger space.
* Effect: Competition, dehydration, reduced intake.
* Fix: **7–10 cm water space per cow**, **60–75 cm manger space per cow**.

---

## 10. Poor Roof Design

* Mistake: Low roof height, no insulation.
* Effect: Excess heat inside shed.
* Fix: **12–14 ft roof height**, ridge ventilation, reflective paint/tiles.

---

## 11. Lack of Biosecurity

* Mistake: No footbath, open access to outsiders.
* Effect: Disease entry from visitors/vehicles.
* Fix: **Footbath at shed entry**, restricted visitor access.

---

## ✅ Summary – Day 25

* Common mistakes include: poor ventilation, overcrowding, wrong orientation, bad drainage, hard floors, low lighting, poor waste handling, and lack of maternity/sick pens.
* These lead to **heat stress, mastitis, lameness, infections, low yield**.
* Good housing = **proper ventilation, space, drainage, bedding, lighting, and waste disposal**.
* For Andhra Pradesh → open, airy, east–west oriented, loose housing with concrete + rubber mats and good drainage is best.
