<h1>🐄 Day 21: Bedding Materials – Sand, Sawdust, Rubber Mats</h1>

---

## 1. Importance of Bedding in Dairy Farms

* Provides **comfortable resting area** → cows should lie down 12–14 hrs/day.
* Reduces risk of **lameness, hock injuries, and mastitis**.
* Keeps cows clean and dry.
* Affects milk yield: comfortable cows = higher milk production.

## 2. Types of Bedding

### **A. Sand Bedding**

* Considered the **gold standard** worldwide for cow comfort.

**Advantages:**
✅ Comfortable, conforms to cow’s body.
✅ Good drainage → keeps udder dry.
✅ Reduces mastitis risk (bacteria cannot grow easily in dry sand).
✅ Long-lasting and inexpensive (in areas where sand is available).

**Disadvantages:**
❌ Heavy to handle, difficult to remove dung.
❌ Wears out pumps/machinery if washed into drains.
❌ Not easily available in all regions.

**Best Use:** Large farms with mechanical manure handling systems.

---

### **B. Sawdust / Straw Bedding**

* Made from sawdust, wood shavings, or crop residues (paddy straw, wheat straw).

**Advantages:**
✅ Cheap and easily available in India.
✅ Soft, comfortable.
✅ Good for small and medium farms.

**Disadvantages:**
❌ Absorbs urine → stays wet, needs frequent replacement.
❌ Bacteria growth risk if not changed daily → mastitis risk.
❌ Creates dust → may cause respiratory issues.

**Best Use:** Small farms with daily labor available for cleaning.

### **C. Rubber Mats**

* Thick mats (10–20 mm) placed over concrete floors.

**Advantages:**
✅ Durable (5–7 years).
✅ Easy to clean and disinfect.
✅ Comfortable compared to bare concrete.
✅ Saves bedding cost long term.

**Disadvantages:**
❌ Higher initial investment.
❌ Harder than sand, needs extra straw/sawdust on top for comfort.
❌ Slippery if wet.

**Best Use:** Commercial farms with concrete flooring, where hygiene & durability are priorities.
