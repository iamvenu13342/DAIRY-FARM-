# 🐄 Day 3: Dairy Farming as a Business – Fixed & Variable Costs

---

## 1. Dairy Farming as a Business

* Dairy farming is **not just an agricultural activity** but a **commercial enterprise**.
* Profitability depends on balancing **investments (fixed costs)** and **running expenses (variable costs)** against **income from milk, dung, and value-added products**.
* Proper cost management ensures **sustainability** and **scalability**.

---

## 2. Fixed Costs in Dairy Farming

Fixed costs = **one-time or long-term investments** that do not change with daily milk production.

**Examples:**

1. **Land & Infrastructure**

   * Land purchase/lease for sheds and fodder cultivation.
   * Construction of cattle sheds, water supply, drainage, feed storage.

2. **Cattle Purchase**

   * Cost of buying high-yielding cows/buffaloes (e.g., HF, Jersey cross).

3. **Equipment & Machinery**

   * Milking machines, chaff cutters, fodder harvesters.
   * Milk storage tanks, cooling/chilling units.

4. **Utilities Setup**

   * Borewell, pumps, biogas plant, electricity connection.

5. **Initial Working Capital (one-time)**

   * Veterinary setup, breeding stock, insurance deposits.

💡 **Key point:** Fixed costs are **high initially**, but spread over many years.

## 3. Variable Costs in Dairy Farming

Variable costs = **recurring expenses** that change depending on herd size and milk production.

**Examples:**

1. **Feed & Fodder**

   * Green fodder (maize, sorghum, napier grass).
   * Dry fodder (paddy straw, groundnut haulm).
   * Concentrates & supplements (oil cakes, mineral mix).
   * Largest share of variable costs (**\~60–70%** of total).

2. **Labor Costs**

   * Salaries/wages for workers handling feeding, cleaning, milking.

3. **Veterinary & Breeding**

   * Regular checkups, vaccinations, deworming.
   * Artificial insemination and fertility care.

4. **Utilities & Maintenance**

   * Electricity for milking machines, water pumps.
   * Shed repairs, machinery servicing.

5. **Transport & Marketing**

   * Transport of milk to chilling centers or dairies.
   * Packaging costs for direct sales.

6. **Insurance Premiums**

   * Cattle insurance against death/disease.

## 4. Cost Breakdown Example (for a 50-Cow Farm)

**Fixed Costs (approximate):**

* Land & Shed construction: ₹15–20 lakhs
* Cattle purchase: ₹25–30 lakhs (50 cows @ ₹50–60k each)
* Equipment & setup: ₹8–10 lakhs
* Total fixed: **₹50–60 lakhs**

**Variable Costs (monthly, approx):**

* Feed & fodder: ₹3–3.5 lakhs
* Labor: ₹1–1.2 lakhs
* Vet & breeding: ₹40–50k
* Utilities & transport: ₹30–40k
* Insurance & misc.: ₹20–30k
* Total variable (monthly): **₹5–6 lakhs**

## 5. Revenue Streams in Dairy Business

1. **Milk Sales** – primary income, daily cash flow.
2. **Dung Sales/Biogas** – as manure or fuel.
3. **Value-added products** – curd, paneer, ghee, flavored milk.
4. **Calf sales** – male/female calves sold for rearing or breeding.

---

## 6. Key Business Insight

* **Fixed costs = Long-term investment.**
* **Variable costs = Ongoing operational expenses.**
* Profitability depends on:

  * Efficient feed management (reduce feed cost without reducing yield).
  * Disease prevention (lower vet costs).
  * Better breeds (higher milk yield).
  * Strong market linkages (stable milk price).

---

## ✅ Summary – Day 3

* Dairy farming should be approached like a **business enterprise**.
* **Fixed costs** include land, shed, cattle, and equipment.
* **Variable costs** include feed, labor, vet care, and utilities.
* Feed alone contributes to **60–70% of total expenses**.
* Careful planning of costs vs income ensures **sustainability and profitability** of a dairy farm.
