<H1>üêÑ Day 27: Biosecurity ‚Äì Keeping Diseases Out of the Farm</H1>

---

## 1. Importance of Biosecurity

* Dairy farms face risks from **infectious diseases** (FMD, Brucellosis, Mastitis, BQ, HS).
* Diseases cause:

  * **Reduced milk yield**.
  * **Infertility & abortions**.
  * **High treatment costs**.
  * **Animal deaths & huge financial loss**.
* Preventing disease entry is **cheaper & easier than treatment**.

---

## 2. Sources of Disease Entry

* New or sick animals.
* Visitors (vets, traders, workers).
* Contaminated feed, water, equipment.
* Insects, rodents, stray dogs.
* Vehicles entering the farm.

## 3. Biosecurity Measures

### **A. Animal Movement**

* Buy cows only from **reliable sources with health records**.
* **Quarantine new animals** for **2‚Äì3 weeks** before mixing with herd.
* Isolate sick animals immediately in a **separate pen**.

### **B. Human & Visitor Control**

* Restrict visitors in cow areas.
* Provide **footbath with disinfectant** at shed entry.
* Workers should use **farm-only clothes & footwear**.
* Wash hands before/after milking.

### **C. Feed & Water Hygiene**

* Use **clean, uncontaminated fodder & concentrates**.
* Store feed in dry, rat-proof stores.
* Provide **clean, fresh water** always.

### **D. Equipment & Shed Hygiene**

* Disinfect buckets, cans, and milking machines daily.
* Clean sheds, troughs, and floors regularly.
* Drainage should prevent water stagnation.

### **E. Vaccination & Deworming**

* Follow **compulsory vaccination schedule**:

  * **FMD (Foot & Mouth Disease):** Twice a year.
  * **HS (Hemorrhagic Septicemia):** Once a year (before monsoon).
  * **BQ (Black Quarter):** Once a year.
  * **Brucellosis:** Calfhood vaccination (females, 4‚Äì8 months).
* Regular **deworming** (every 3‚Äì4 months).

### **F. Pest & Rodent Control**

* Control flies, ticks, and mosquitoes (use sprays, nets, herbal repellents).
* Keep rodent traps in feed stores.

## 4. Farm Design for Biosecurity

* Fence entire farm ‚Üí prevents entry of stray animals.
* Provide **separate entry for people & vehicles**.
* Maintain **clean zones (cow shed, milking parlour)** vs. **dirty zones (manure pit, drainage)**.
* Always move from **healthy cows ‚Üí sick cows**, not the reverse.

---

## 5. Record Keeping

* Maintain **disease & treatment records** for each cow.
* Monitor milk yield drops ‚Üí early sign of illness.
* Record vaccination & deworming dates.

---

## 6. Best Practices for Andhra Pradesh Dairy Farms

* Strict **vaccination against FMD & HS** (common in AP).
* Isolate **newly purchased or sick cows**.
* Use **footbath + worker hygiene** at entry.
* Proper waste disposal to control flies & mosquitoes.
* Adopt **biogas or manure pits** to reduce infection spread.

---

## ‚úÖ Summary ‚Äì Day 27

* Biosecurity = **keeping disease out of the farm**.
* Key measures: **quarantine, vaccination, hygiene, visitor control, feed/water safety, pest control**.
* For Andhra Pradesh ‚Üí focus on **FMD, HS, BQ, Brucellosis prevention**.
* Strong biosecurity = **healthy herd, higher milk yield, and long-term profitability**.
