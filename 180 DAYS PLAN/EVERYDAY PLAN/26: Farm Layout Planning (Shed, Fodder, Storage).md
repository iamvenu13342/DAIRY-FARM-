<H1>🐄 Day 26: Farm Layout Planning (Shed, Fodder, Storage)</H1>

---

## 1. Importance of Farm Layout

* Efficient use of **land, labor, and resources**.
* Reduces stress for cows (easy movement).
* Minimizes disease risk (clean separation of areas).
* Saves time & effort in daily activities (feeding, milking, cleaning).

---

## 2. Key Components in a Dairy Farm Layout

### **A. Cow Sheds**

* **Loose housing system** recommended for Andhra Pradesh.
* Orientation: **East–West** (reduces direct sunlight inside).
* Space: **10–12 m² per cow** (covered + open paddock).
* Roof height: **12–14 ft** for ventilation.
* Flooring: **concrete with slope 1:60**, rubber mats in resting area.

---

### **B. Calf Pens & Maternity Pens**

* **Calf pens:** 1.2–3 m² per calf depending on age.
* **Maternity pens:** 12–15 m² per cow, 1 per 20–25 cows.
* Location: Near main shed for easy monitoring.

---

### **C. Milking Parlour**

* Located close to cow shed for easy cow movement.
* Non-slippery floors, 150–200 lux lighting.
* Waiting area space: 1.5–1.8 m² per cow.

---

### **D. Fodder Production & Storage**

* **Fodder cultivation plots**: ideally adjacent to farm, irrigated with slurry/manure.
* **Silage pit / trench silo**: 1 cubic meter feeds 1 adult cow for \~30 days.
* **Hay shed**: Dry storage for crop residues & straw.
* Keep fodder stores **separate from cow sheds** to prevent dampness & fire hazards.

---

### **E. Feed & Concentrate Store**

* Dry, rat-proof, well-ventilated room.
* Capacity: Store at least **1 month’s feed stock**.
* Raised floor (30 cm above ground) to avoid moisture.

---

### **F. Water Supply**

* Continuous water in **troughs or automatic drinkers**.
* 1 trough per 25 cows, or 1 drinker per 15 cows.
* Borewell + storage tank with pipelines.

---

### **G. Drainage & Waste Disposal**

* Slope floor → open drains (10–15 cm wide).
* Dung pit / biogas plant at **lower side of farm**.
* Slurry returned to fodder fields = **nutrient cycle**.

---

### **H. Other Essential Facilities**

* **Office/Record Room:** For accounts, records, medicines.
* **Veterinary / Sick Pen:** 9–12 m² per cow, isolated from herd.
* **Farm roads & pathways:** Wide enough (3 m) for tractor/trolley.
* **Fencing:** Barbed wire or chain link for security.

## 3. Example Layout – 50 Cow Farm (Andhra Pradesh)

1. **Cow shed:** Central location (50 cows).
2. **Calf pens + maternity pens:** One side of shed.
3. **Milking parlour + milk storage room:** Adjacent to cow shed.
4. **Fodder store & silage pit:** Behind sheds, near fields.
5. **Feed store & equipment room:** Close to shed for daily use.
6. **Dung pit / biogas plant:** Downwind, away from shed, near fodder plots.
7. **Office + worker quarters:** At entrance for supervision.
8. **Water tank & borewell:** Centralized supply for shed + fields.

---

## 4. Best Practices for Andhra Pradesh

* Use **natural ventilation** with open-sided sheds.
* Plan **shady trees** (neem, tamarind, coconut) around paddocks.
* Build **silage pits** before summer for year-round fodder.
* Keep **clean separation** between housing, fodder, and waste disposal.

---

## ✅ Summary – Day 26

* Farm layout should include **cow sheds, calf/maternity pens, milking parlour, fodder storage, feed store, drainage, dung pit/biogas, office, and fencing**.
* Good design = **less labor, healthy cows, and higher productivity**.
* For **50-cow farm in Andhra Pradesh**: Central cow shed + adjacent milking parlour, feed/fodder stores at back, waste system downhill, office at entrance.
