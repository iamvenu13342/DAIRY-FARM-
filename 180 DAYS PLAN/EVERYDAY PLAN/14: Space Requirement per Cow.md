<h1>🐄 Day 14: Space Requirement per Cow</h1>

---

## 1. Importance of Space in Dairy Farming

* Adequate space ensures:

  * Better cow comfort → higher milk yield.
  * Reduced disease spread.
  * Less aggression (kicking, fighting).
  * Easy cleaning & waste management.
* Overcrowding leads to **stress, mastitis, low fertility, and reduced production**.

---

## 2. Housing Systems in Dairy Farming

There are mainly **two types of housing systems**:

1. **Loose Housing System**

   * Cows kept free inside an open paddock with covered resting area.
   * Popular in India for medium–large farms.
   * Cheaper, provides freedom of movement.

2. **Conventional/Closed Housing System**

   * Cows tied individually in stalls.
   * Easier for individual cow monitoring.
   * Labor-intensive, less comfortable for cows.
