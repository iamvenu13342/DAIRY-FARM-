<h1>üêÑ Day 11: Selecting Cows for Purchase ‚Äì Age, Lactation, Health</h1>

---

## 1. Importance of Careful Selection

* Cows are the **biggest investment** in a dairy farm (50‚Äì60% of total cost).
* Proper selection ensures:

  * **High milk yield** from the start.
  * **Low disease risk**.
  * **Longer productive life**.
* Poor selection ‚Üí low yield, high medical costs, early culling.

---

## 2. Ideal Age for Purchase

* **First calving age:** 2.5‚Äì3 years.
* **Best purchase age:** **2.5‚Äì5 years** (young but proven milk producers).
* Avoid:

  * Very old cows (>8 years).
  * Very young heifers (not yet calved) unless for future breeding.

---

## 3. Lactation Stage to Consider

* Cows produce milk in **lactation cycles** (305 days milk + 60 days dry period).
* **Best time to buy:** **Early lactation (1‚Äì3 months after calving)**.

  * Cow has proven it can give milk.
  * You get maximum yield period.
* Avoid:

  * Cows in **late lactation** (yield will soon drop).
  * **Dry cows** (no milk income immediately).

## 4. Health Indicators

### **General Health Check**

* Bright eyes, alert, active.
* Smooth coat, no rough or patchy hair.
* Normal breathing, no nasal discharge.
* Clean udder without swelling or sores.

* 4 well-formed teats.
* No history of **mastitis** (udder infection).

### **Body Condition**

* Body Condition Score (BCS) ideally **3‚Äì3.5 out of 5**.

### **Reproductive Health**

* History of regular calving every **12‚Äì14 months**.
* No reproductive disorders (retained placenta, abortion history).

## 5. Documentation & Verification

* Ask for **milk yield records** (last lactation performance).
* Check **vaccination and deworming history**.
* Verify **breed purity** (especially for Gir, Sahiwal, HF-cross, Jersey-cross).
* Ensure **cattle insurance** if possible.

---

## 6. Red Flags ‚Äì Avoid Buying Cows if:

* Check for **good health, udder condition, body condition, and fertility**.
* Avoid old, sick, infertile, or unproductive cows.
* Proper selection = **healthy herd + higher milk yield + long-term profitability**.
