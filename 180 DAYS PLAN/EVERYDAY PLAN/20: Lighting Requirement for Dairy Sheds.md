<h1>🐄 Day 20: Lighting Requirement for Dairy Sheds</h1>

---

## 1. Importance of Lighting in Dairy Farms

* Cows are sensitive to **day length and light exposure**.
* Proper lighting helps in:

  * **Higher milk yield** (stimulates hormone secretion).
  * **Better fertility & heat detection** (cows show estrus signs clearly in light).
  * **Reduced stress & accidents** inside shed.
  * **Ease of farm work** (feeding, cleaning, milking).

---

## 2. Light Duration (Photoperiod)

* Research shows **16–18 hours of light per day** improves milk production.
* **Light intensity requirement:**

  * **50–70 lux** (general cow shed).
  * **150–200 lux** (milking parlour, hospital/sick pen).
* Darkness of **6–8 hours** is also important for cow rest.

💡 Example: Farmers in Andhra Pradesh can combine **natural sunlight + artificial lights** to meet this requirement.

## 3. Types of Lighting

### **A. Natural Lighting**

* Achieved through open-sided sheds and transparent roofing sheets (polycarbonate/FRP).
* Shed orientation: **East–West** → reduces direct sunlight entering.
* Advantage: Low cost, energy saving.

### **B. Artificial Lighting**

* **LED lights** preferred → energy efficient, long-lasting.
* Provide **uniform distribution** to avoid dark corners.
* Waterproof, dustproof fixtures recommended for sheds.

## 4. Lighting in Different Shed Areas

| Area                  | Light Intensity | Duration  | Notes                                |
| --------------------- | --------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Cow resting shed**  | 50–70 lux       | 16 hrs    | Enough for comfort, visibility       |
| **Milking parlour**   | 150–200 lux     | As needed | For milking, cleaning udder, hygiene |
| **Calving/sick pen**  | 150 lux         | 16 hrs    | Close monitoring of animals          |
| **Feed & water area** | 100 lux         | 16 hrs    | Helps cows find feed easily          |
| **Office/store**      | 200 lux         | Work hrs  | Record keeping, management           |

## 5. Benefits of Proper Lighting

* Increases **milk yield by 5–15%** (due to longer feeding & activity time).
* Improves **heat detection** → better breeding success.
* Reduces **injuries** (cows see clearly at night).
* Enhances **worker efficiency** in feeding, milking, and cleaning.

---

## 6. Best Practices for Andhra Pradesh Dairy Farms

* Use **natural daylight** during the day (open sides + skylight roofing).
* Install **LED tube lights or hanging lamps** for evenings and cloudy days.
* Provide **16 hrs light + 8 hrs dark** daily.
* Arrange lights at **8–10 ft height** to cover whole shed uniformly.
* Backup **solar lights or inverter system** for power cuts.

---

## ✅ Summary – Day 20

* Dairy cows need **16–18 hrs of light/day** → improves milk yield & fertility.
* **50–70 lux** in resting areas, **150–200 lux** in milking parlour & calving pens.
* Combine **natural sunlight + LED lighting** for best results.
* For Andhra Pradesh, use **open-sided sheds (daytime) + LED tube lights (nighttime)**.
