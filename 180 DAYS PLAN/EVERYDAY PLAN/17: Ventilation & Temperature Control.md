<h1>🐄 Day 17: Ventilation & Temperature Control</h1>

---

## 1. Importance

* Cows are **sensitive to heat and poor air quality**.
* Ideal **comfort temperature (Thermo-Neutral Zone): 5–25°C**.
* Above **28–30°C**, cows enter **heat stress** → reduced feed intake, lower milk yield, fertility problems.
* Good ventilation + cooling = **better health, productivity, and longevity**.

---

## 2. Signs of Heat Stress in Cows

* Panting, rapid breathing.
* Drooling or open-mouth breathing.
* Reduced feed & water intake.
* Standing more, lying less.
* Drop in milk yield.
* Crowding near water troughs.

## 3. Ventilation in Dairy Sheds

### **A. Natural Ventilation**

* Open-sided sheds with **asbestos/metal roofs**.
* Ridge vent at roof top for hot air escape.
* Side walls only 3–4 ft high, above open for airflow.
* Orientation of shed: **East–West** (reduces direct sun inside shed).

### **B. Mechanical Ventilation**

* **Ceiling/axial fans**: Improve air movement, reduce humidity.
* **Exhaust fans**: Remove stale, humid air.
* **Foggers/sprinklers**: Combine with fans for evaporative cooling.

---

## 4. Temperature Control Methods

### **A. Shade Management**

* Plant **trees (neem, banyan, coconut)** around sheds.
* Use **shade nets** in open paddocks.

### **B. Cooling Systems**

* **Sprinkler + Fan System (Most effective):** Spray fine water droplets → evaporates → cooling effect.
* **Misting/Fogging System:** Creates cool microclimate (works best in dry climates).
* **Water-soaked gunny bags on shed roof** in summer (low-cost method).

### **C. Floor Cooling**

* Sprinkle water on floors → lowers surface temperature.

---

## 5. Temperature-Humidity Index (THI)

* THI > 72 = cows under **heat stress**.
* Andhra Pradesh summer (40°C + humidity) → **high THI zone** → special cooling required.

---

## 6. Water Requirement

* Heat-stressed cows drink **80–120 liters/day**.
* Provide **24/7 access to clean, cool water** in multiple troughs.

---

## 7. Best Practices for Andhra Pradesh

* **Loose housing** with open sides.
* Roof height: **12–14 ft** for airflow.
* Ridge vent for hot air escape.
* Fans + sprinklers during peak summer (April–June).
* White paint/reflective sheet on roof → reduces heat absorption.
* Extra focus on **pregnant & high-yielding cows** (most sensitive to heat).

## 8. Quick Comparison

| Method             | Cost        | Effectiveness | Best Use             |
| ------------------ | ----------- | ------------- | -------------------- |
| Open-sided shed    | Low         | Moderate      | All farms            |
| Fans               | Medium      | Good          | Medium/large farms   |
| Sprinklers/Foggers | Medium–High | Very good     | Hot & dry regions    |
| Shade trees/nets   | Very Low    | Moderate      | Small farms          |
| Roof cooling       | Low         | Moderate      | Emergency summer use |

---

## ✅ Summary – Day 17

* Cows need **5–25°C** comfort range; above 28°C = stress.
* Provide **natural + mechanical ventilation**.
* Use **fans + sprinklers/foggers** for summer cooling.
* Ensure **plenty of clean water**.
* For Andhra Pradesh, design sheds with **open sides, high roof, ridge vent, and shade**.
