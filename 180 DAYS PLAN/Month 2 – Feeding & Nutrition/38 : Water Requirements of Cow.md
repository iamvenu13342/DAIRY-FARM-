<h1>🐄 Day 38 : Water Requirements of Cows**.</h1>

Water is the **most essential nutrient** for dairy cows – more important than feed, because **milk itself is 85–87% water**.



---

## 1. Importance of Water

* Maintains **milk production** (direct link between water intake & milk yield).
* Aids **digestion, nutrient absorption, body temperature control, and waste removal**.
* Cows deprived of water → immediate drop in **feed intake, milk yield, and fertility**.

---

## 2. Daily Water Requirement

Depends on **milk yield, body weight, feed type, and climate**.

* **Maintenance (non-lactating cow):** 30–50 liters/day.
* **Lactating cow:**

  * For every **1 liter milk → 3–5 liters water needed**.
  * Average 15–20 liters milk/day → **60–100 liters/day**.
* **Pregnant cows & high yielders:** 80–120 liters/day.
* **Calves:** 5–15 liters/day.

👉 In **Andhra Pradesh (hot climate):** water need can increase by **20–30%** (up to 120 liters/day per cow in summer).

---

## 3. Factors Affecting Water Intake

* **Milk yield:** Higher yield = more water required.
* **Feed type:**

  * Dry fodder diet (straw) → more water needed.
  * Green fodder/silage diet → less extra water needed (since fodder contains 70–80% water).
* **Climate:** Hot, humid weather → more water for cooling.
* **Salt/mineral intake:** Increases thirst.
* **Body weight & age:** Larger/heavier cows drink more.

---

## 4. Water Supply Systems

### **A. Troughs (Open Tanks)**

* Concrete/brick water troughs in shed & paddock.
* Need regular cleaning to avoid contamination.

### **B. Automatic Drinkers**

* Float-valve system ensures **24/7 fresh water**.
* Saves labor, reduces wastage, more hygienic.

### **C. Buckets (Calves)**

* For young calves → small clean buckets/bowls.

---

## 5. Water Quality Standards

* **Clear, odorless, cool (15–25°C)**.
* Free from dung, urine, algae, pesticides.
* TDS (Total Dissolved Solids): < 1,000 ppm preferred.
* Bacteria-free (regular cleaning & disinfection).

---

## 6. Best Practices for Andhra Pradesh Dairy Farms

* Provide water **at least 3–4 times/day** if no automatic system.
* Place troughs near **feeding area & milking parlour**.
* Ensure **shaded water points** in summer.
* Maintain **1 trough for every 25 cows**.
* Clean troughs daily with brush & disinfectant.
* For **50-cow farm → at least 2–3 large troughs + 2 automatic drinkers** recommended.

## 7. Quick Snapshot

| Animal Type               | Daily Water Need |
| ------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Dry cow                   | 30–50 L          |
| Lactating cow             | 60–120 L         |
| Calf                      | 5–15 L           |
| High yielders (25 L milk) | 100–120 L        |

## ✅ Summary – Day 38

* Water = **life & milk** for dairy cows.
* Lactating cow needs **60–120 L/day**, depending on yield & climate.
* Quality matters: must be **clean, cool, bacteria-free**.
* In AP → water need increases in summer → ensure **round-the-clock supply**.
* Best system: **mix of troughs + automatic drinkers**.
