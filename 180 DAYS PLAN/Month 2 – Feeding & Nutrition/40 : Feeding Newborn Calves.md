<h1>🐄 Day 40 Notes: Feeding Newborn Calves.</h1>

Calf feeding in the **first 3 months** decides its growth, immunity, and future milk yield.

---


## 1. Importance

* First 3 months = **critical stage** → calf must get strong immunity & growth.
* Proper feeding ensures:
  ✅ Healthy adult cow/bull.
  ✅ Reduced calf mortality.
  ✅ Better fertility & future milk yield.

---

## 2. Feeding Stages

### **A. Colostrum Feeding (Day 1–4)**

* **First milk after calving (colostrum)**.
* Rich in **antibodies, protein, vitamins A & E**.
* Must feed within **2 hours of birth** (gut absorbs antibodies only in first 24 hrs).

**Guideline:**

* Quantity: **10% of body weight/day** (3–4 L/day for normal calf).
* Frequency: 3–4 times/day.

---

### **B. Whole Milk Feeding (Day 5–30)**

* Feed mother’s milk or pooled milk.
* **Quantity:** 1/10th of calf’s body weight.
* Frequency: 2–3 times/day.
* Keep feeding equipment **clean & disinfected**.

---

### **C. Milk Replacer (Optional, after 2 weeks)**

* Powdered feed with protein (22%), fat (10–15%), vitamins & minerals.
* Mixed in lukewarm water.
* Used if whole milk is costly or needed for sale.

---

### **D. Introduction of Calf Starter (Day 15 onwards)**

* Special concentrate mix (20–22% protein, grains + oil cakes + minerals).
* Improves rumen development.
* Start with small handful → increase gradually to 0.5–1 kg/day by 3 months.

---

### **E. Green & Dry Fodder (After 1 month)**

* Small amounts of tender green fodder (lucerne, cowpea) + good hay.
* Helps rumen papillae grow → prepares calf for adult digestion.

---

### **F. Water**

* Always provide **clean fresh water** from Day 1 (separate from milk feeding).

## 3. Example Feeding Schedule

| Age of Calf | Milk/Day          | Calf Starter | Fodder             | Notes                           |
| ----------- | ----------------- | ------------ | ------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| 0–4 days    | Colostrum (3–4 L) | –            | –                  | Must feed within 2 hrs of birth |
| 5–30 days   | 3–4 L whole milk  | –            | –                  | Feed 2–3 times/day              |
| 15–30 days  | 3–4 L milk        | Handful/day  | Small green fodder | Introduce calf starter          |
| 1–2 months  | 2–3 L milk        | 0.25–0.5 kg  | Greens + hay       | Rumen starts developing         |
| 2–3 months  | 1–2 L milk        | 0.5–1 kg     | Regular            | Weaning stage                   |
| 3+ months   | Stop milk         | 1–1.5 kg     | Greens + hay       | Calf eats like adult            |

---

## 4. Weaning (Stopping Milk)

* Ideal at **90 days (3 months)**.
* Condition: Calf eats **>1 kg calf starter + fodder** daily.
* Weaning earlier saves milk for sale but requires good calf starter.

---

## 5. Best Practices for Andhra Pradesh

* Feed **colostrum properly** (many farmers neglect this).
* Use **milk replacer** if milk is costly.
* Grow **legume fodder** (stylo, cowpea) for calf feeding.
* APDDCF supplies **calf starter & mineral mixture** under subsidy schemes.

---

## ✅ Summary – Day 40

* **Colostrum within 2 hrs** = life-saving immunity.
* Feed milk for **up to 3 months**, gradually replacing with calf starter & fodder.
* Always provide **fresh water & clean feeding equipment**.
* Weaning at 3 months = calf eats starter + fodder independently.
* Healthy calf → **healthy future dairy cow = higher milk yield**.
