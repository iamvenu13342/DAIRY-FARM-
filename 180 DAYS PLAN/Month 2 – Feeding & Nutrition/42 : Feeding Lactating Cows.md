<h1>🐄 Day 42: Feeding Lactating Cows</h1>

This is the most critical stage, as **nutrition directly impacts milk yield, fat %, and cow health**.



---

## 1. Importance

* Lactation = **highest nutrient demand** in cow’s life.
* Proper feeding ensures:
  ✅ High & sustained milk yield.
  ✅ Good milk fat & SNF %.
  ✅ Quick recovery after calving.
  ✅ Fertility & next lactation cycle.

## 2. Nutritional Needs of Lactating Cows

* **Energy:** For milk production & body maintenance.

  * Sources: Maize, barley, sorghum, molasses.
* **Protein:** For milk protein & body tissue repair.

  * Sources: Groundnut cake, soybean meal, cottonseed cake.
* **Fiber:** Maintains rumen health, prevents acidosis.

  * Sources: Paddy straw, maize stover, hay.
* **Minerals & Vitamins:** For milk fat %, fertility, calf growth.

  * Provide **50–100 g mineral mixture + 30 g salt daily**.
* **Water:** 3–5 liters per 1 liter milk → 80–120 liters/day.

## 3. Balanced Ration Formula

### **For a 15 L/day Milk Yielding Cow (AP Example)**

* Green fodder: 20–25 kg (Napier, maize, cowpea).
* Dry fodder: 6–7 kg (urea-treated paddy straw preferred).
* Concentrates: 5–6 kg (mix of maize, oil cakes, bran).
* Mineral mixture: 75 g.
* Salt: 30 g.
* Water: 80–100 liters.

👉 **Rule of Thumb:** 1 kg concentrate per **2.5–3 liters milk** produced.

## 4. Feeding Strategy During Lactation

### **A. Early Lactation (0–70 days)**

* Peak milk yield, cow in **negative energy balance**.
* Feed high-energy concentrates + good quality fodder.
* Prevent weight loss & ketosis.

### **B. Mid Lactation (70–200 days)**

* Milk yield stabilizes.
* Balanced ration: fodder + concentrates.
* Focus on fertility (prepare for next pregnancy).

### **C. Late Lactation (200–305 days)**

* Yield declines.
* Reduce concentrates gradually.
* Focus on restoring body condition for dry period.

---

## 5. Feeding Practices

* Provide fodder first, then concentrates → prevents acidosis.
* Split concentrates into **2–3 feedings/day**.
* Always provide **clean water near feed area**.
* Include **by-products** (molasses, distillers’ grains, rice bran) to cut cost.
* Maintain **consistent feeding times**.

---

## 6. Andhra Pradesh Perspective

* **Paddy straw + green fodder (maize, Napier, cowpea)** = main base.
* Oil cakes (groundnut, sunflower, cottonseed) readily available.
* Rice bran & maize used as cheap energy sources.
* Farmers should adopt **ration balancing programme (RBP)** promoted by APDDCF & NABARD.

---

## 7. Example Daily Diets

**For 10 L/day cow:**

* Green fodder: 15 kg
* Dry fodder: 5 kg
* Concentrate: 3.5–4 kg

**For 20 L/day cow:**

* Green fodder: 25 kg
* Dry fodder: 7 kg
* Concentrate: 7–8 kg

---

## ✅ Summary – Day 42

* Lactating cows need **balanced ration = fodder + concentrates + minerals + water**.
* Rule: **1 kg concentrate per 2.5–3 L milk**.
* Feed strategy changes by lactation stage (early, mid, late).
* In AP: focus on **paddy straw (treated) + Napier/maize fodder + oil cakes + rice bran + mineral mix**.
* Good feeding → **high milk yield, fertility, and long productive life**.
