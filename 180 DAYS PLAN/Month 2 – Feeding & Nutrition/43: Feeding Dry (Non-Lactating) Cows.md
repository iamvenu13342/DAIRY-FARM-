<h1>🐄 Day 43: Feeding Dry (Non-Lactating) Cows.</h1>

The **dry period (last 60 days before calving)** is as important as lactation because it **prepares the cow for next milk cycle and calf birth**.

---

## 1. Importance of Dry Period Feeding

* Allows udder tissue to **regenerate** for next lactation.
* Provides nutrients for **growing fetus**.
* Prevents metabolic diseases (milk fever, ketosis, retained placenta).
* Ensures **smooth calving and good milk yield** in next lactation.

---

## 2. Nutritional Needs of Dry Cows

* **Energy:** Moderate – avoid overfeeding → prevents obesity.

  * Sources: Maize, sorghum, limited grains.
* **Protein:** Required for fetal growth.

  * Sources: Oil cakes, legume fodder, bran.
* **Fiber:** Essential for rumen health.

  * Sources: Paddy straw, hay, silage.
* **Minerals & Vitamins:**

  * Calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, selenium, iodine.
  * Vitamins A, D, E for reproduction & immunity.
* **Water:** 40–60 liters/day.

## 3. Balanced Ration Formula (AP Example)

### **For a 350–400 kg Dry Cow (Last 60 Days Before Calving)**

* Green fodder: 15–20 kg (maize, cowpea, Napier).
* Dry fodder: 6–7 kg (paddy straw, preferably urea-treated).
* Concentrates: 2–3 kg (oil cake + bran mix).
* Mineral mixture: 75–100 g.
* Salt: 30 g.
* Water: 50 L.

---

## 4. Feeding Strategy

### **A. Far-off Dry Period (60–21 days before calving)**

* Maintain moderate energy intake.
* Diet: Mostly fodder (70%) + limited concentrates (30%).
* Aim: Maintain body condition, prevent fat cow syndrome.

### **B. Close-up Dry Period (last 3 weeks before calving)**

* Increase **concentrates gradually** → prepares rumen for lactation diet.
* Feed more **protein & minerals (Ca, P, Mg, Se)**.
* Avoid sudden feed changes at calving.

---

## 5. Special Precautions

* Avoid **too much calcium** before calving → prevents milk fever.
* Provide **anionic salts** (if available) → balance minerals.
* Ensure **selenium & vitamin E** → reduces retained placenta.
* Deworm & vaccinate during dry period → protects both cow & calf.

---

## 6. Andhra Pradesh Perspective

* Farmers often **neglect dry cows** (only give straw).
* Leads to: weak calf, poor milk yield, calving problems.
* Recommended:
  ✅ Urea-treated paddy straw + legume fodder.
  ✅ 2–3 kg concentrate mix daily.
  ✅ Mineral mixture (APDDCF supplies area-specific).
  ✅ Good water supply even if cow is not milking.

## 7. Quick Snapshot

| Stage                    | Diet Focus                   | Concentrate Use |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------- | --------------- |
| Far-off dry (60–21 days) | Moderate energy + high fiber | 2 kg/day        |
| Close-up (21–0 days)     | More protein + minerals      | 3 kg/day        |

---

## ✅ Summary – Day 43

* Dry period feeding = **investment for next lactation**.
* Balanced ration: **fodder + 2–3 kg concentrates + minerals + water**.
* Two stages: **Far-off (maintain body condition)**, **Close-up (prepare for calving & lactation)**.
* In AP, farmers must avoid neglect → use **treated paddy straw + legume fodder + mineral mix**.
* Healthy dry cow → **easy calving + strong calf + higher milk yield**.
