<H1>Day 36 Notes: Concentrates – Oil Cakes, Maize, Grains.</H1>

Concentrates are **high-energy and high-protein feeds** that boost milk yield when combined with fodder.

# 🐄 Day 36: Concentrates – Oil Cakes, Maize, Grains

---

## 1. Importance of Concentrates

* Supply **energy, protein, and minerals** that fodder alone cannot provide.
* Essential for **high-yielding cows**.
* Improve **milk yield, fat %, fertility, and calf growth**.
* Should form **25–30% of daily ration** (balance with fodder).

---

## 2. Types of Concentrates

### **A. Oil Cakes (Protein-rich)**

By-products of oilseed extraction.

* **Groundnut cake:** 40–45% protein, good quality.
* **Cottonseed cake:** 25–30% protein, good for fat yield (limit due to gossypol).
* **Soybean meal:** 40–45% protein, rich in amino acids.
* **Sesame cake:** 35–40% protein, high digestibility.
* **Sunflower cake:** 28–32% protein, fibrous.

**Role:**

* Supply **protein** for milk synthesis & body maintenance.
* Improve **fertility and calf growth**.

---

### **B. Energy Sources (Grains & Maize)**

* **Maize (corn):** Highly digestible starch, good energy feed.
* **Barley, Wheat, Sorghum:** Provide starch & energy.
* **Broken rice / rice bran:** Energy + moderate protein.
* **Molasses:** Provides sugar, improves palatability.

**Role:**

* Provide **energy for milk yield**.
* Maintain body weight & prevent negative energy balance.

---

### **C. Agro-Industrial By-products**

* Rice bran, wheat bran → moderate energy & protein.
* Distillers’ grains (DDGS) → protein + energy.

## 3. Nutrient Contribution

| Feed Type    | Protein (%) | Energy Value | Special Notes             |
| ------------ | ----------- | ------------ | ------------------------- |
| Oil cakes    | 25–45       | Medium       | Protein for milk & growth |
| Maize        | 8–10        | Very high    | Best energy source        |
| Wheat/Barley | 10–12       | High         | Energy + some protein     |
| Bran         | 12–15       | Medium       | Rich in fiber             |
| Molasses     | 0–3         | High sugar   | Improves taste            |

---

## 4. Feeding Guidelines

* **Rule of thumb:** 1 kg concentrate per **2.5–3 liters milk produced** (in addition to maintenance needs).
* High-yielding cows (20 liters/day) → 6–7 kg concentrates daily.
* Always feed concentrates **after roughages** to prevent acidosis.
* Mix concentrates with **mineral mixture & salt**.
* Avoid sudden changes → adjust gradually.

---

## 5. Benefits of Concentrates

* Increase **milk yield & quality**.
* Support **early lactation (peak yield)**.
* Balance low-quality roughages (e.g., paddy straw).
* Reduce fertility problems due to nutritional gaps.

---

## 6. Andhra Pradesh Perspective

* **Maize & rice bran** → widely available in AP.
* Oil cakes (groundnut, sunflower, cottonseed) → abundant due to oilseed cultivation.
* Farmers should use **locally available oil cakes + maize + bran** to reduce cost.
* NABARD & APDDCF promote **balanced concentrate mixtures** for small farmers.

---

## ✅ Summary – Day 36

* Concentrates = **protein + energy feeds** to balance fodder diet.
* **Oil cakes:** Protein-rich (25–45%).
* **Maize & grains:** High energy.
* **Rule:** 1 kg concentrate per 2.5–3 L milk yield.
* For AP farms → use **maize, rice bran, groundnut/sunflower cakes** for cost-effective rations.
