<H1>🐄 Day 51: Fodder Crop – Cowpea.</H1>

Cowpea (*Vigna unguiculata*) is a **leguminous fodder crop** highly valued in dairy farming for its **high protein content and soil enrichment**.


---

## 1. Introduction

* Scientific name: *Vigna unguiculata*.
* Common name: **Lobia / Alasandalu (అలసందలు in Telugu)**.
* Dual-purpose crop: used for **fodder + pulses**.
* Widely cultivated in **Andhra Pradesh** (esp. coastal & irrigated regions).

---

## 2. Advantages of Cowpea as Fodder

✅ **High protein** (16–20%) → balances cereal fodder (maize, sorghum, Napier).
✅ **Palatable & digestible** → cows eat it readily.
✅ **Nitrogen-fixing legume** → improves soil fertility.
✅ **Quick growing** → ready in 45–50 days.
✅ Can be grown **alone or intercropped** with maize, sorghum, Napier.

## 3. Nutritional Value (per 100 kg green fodder)

* Dry Matter: 20–25 kg.
* Crude Protein: 16–20%.
* Total Digestible Nutrients (TDN): 60–65%.
* Calcium: 1.0%.
* Phosphorus: 0.25–0.3%.
  👉 Best legume fodder → **rich in protein, minerals & vitamins**.

---

## 4. Varieties

* **APC-1, APC-2** (Andhra Pradesh varieties).
* **Bundel Lobia series** (from IGFRI).
* **CO-5 Cowpea** (high yield, popular in South India).

---

## 5. Cultivation Practices

* **Soil:** Grows well in sandy loam to loamy soils.
* **Season:** Kharif (monsoon) and summer.
* **Sowing:** 8–10 kg seed/acre.
* **Spacing:** 30 × 15 cm.
* **Fertilizer:** Less fertilizer needed (fixes nitrogen).
* **Irrigation:** 2–3 irrigations sufficient in summer.
* **Harvesting:**

  * First cut: 45–50 days (before flowering).
  * Regrowth possible for 2–3 cuts.

---

## 6. Feeding Guidelines

* Feed **8–10 kg/cow/day** (green fodder).
* Always **mix with cereal fodder** (maize, sorghum, Napier) → prevents bloating.
* Suitable for **hay & silage preparation**.
* Best used as **protein supplement** in ration.

---

## 7. Challenges

* If fed in **excess alone** → may cause bloating.
* Susceptible to pests (aphids, leaf spot).
* Requires good seed selection for high yield.
* Needs careful storage if used for hay → prone to fungus.

---

## 8. Andhra Pradesh Perspective

* Cowpea is widely used in **mixed fodder systems** (Maize + Cowpea, Sorghum + Cowpea).
* Popular among dairy farmers for **protein balance & soil fertility improvement**.
* Recommended by **APDDCF** as intercrop with Napier & maize for balanced fodder supply.

---

## ✅ Summary – Day 51

* Cowpea = **best legume fodder for dairy cows**.
* Nutrition: **16–20% protein, 60–65% TDN**.
* Feed: **8–10 kg/cow/day** (mixed with cereals).
* Harvest: **45–50 days**, multiple cuts possible.
* In AP: used in **fodder mixtures** (Maize+Cowpea, Sorghum+Cowpea).
* Benefit: Improves **milk yield, soil fertility, and reduces feed cost**.
