<H1>🐄 Day 49: Fodder Crop – Maize.</H1>

Maize (*Zea mays*) is one of the **most important cereal fodder crops** for dairy cows, widely grown in **Andhra Pradesh** and across India.



## 1. Introduction

* Scientific name: *Zea mays*.
* Used as **dual-purpose crop** → grains for humans & cattle feed + green plants for fodder/silage.
* Highly suitable for **silage making** → ensures fodder availability in summer.
* Very popular in Andhra Pradesh due to adaptability.

## 2. Advantages of Maize Fodder

✅ **Nutritious**: Rich in energy & digestible carbohydrates.
✅ **Silage-friendly**: Best crop for silage due to high sugar content.
✅ **Fast-growing**: Ready for harvest in 60–75 days.
✅ **Palatable**: Cows like it → improves intake.
✅ Can be grown in all seasons (with irrigation).

## 3. Nutritional Value (per 100 kg green fodder)

* Dry Matter: 25–30 kg.
* Crude Protein: 8–9%.
* Total Digestible Nutrients (TDN): 65–70%.
* Calcium: 0.25–0.3%.
* Phosphorus: 0.25–0.3%.
  👉 Rich in **energy**, moderate in **protein** (must mix with legume fodder).

## 4. Varieties for Fodder & Silage

* **African Tall** (traditional fodder maize).
* **J-1006, Ganga-5, Shaktiman series**.
* **AP hybrids** developed for high yield.
* **QPM (Quality Protein Maize)** → higher protein content.

---

## 5. Cultivation Practices

* **Soil:** Well-drained loamy soils, pH 6.0–7.5.
* **Season:** Can be grown in **Kharif, Rabi, or Summer**.
* **Sowing:** 20–25 kg seed/acre.
* **Spacing:** 30 × 60 cm (fodder maize) or 30 × 30 cm (dense sowing for silage).
* **Manuring:** 10–12 tons FYM + 40–50 kg Nitrogen/acre.
* **Irrigation:** Every 7–10 days.
* **Harvesting:**

  * For fodder: At **50% flowering** (60–75 days).
  * For silage: At **dough stage (80–90 days)** when sugar is high.

---

## 6. Feeding Guidelines

* Feed **15–20 kg green maize per cow/day** (part of ration).
* Best used as **chopped fodder or silage**.
* Mix with legume fodder (cowpea, lucerne, berseem) for protein balance.
* Avoid feeding immature (too young) plants → may cause nitrate poisoning.

---

## 7. Challenges

* Low in crude protein → must be supplemented with legumes.
* Susceptible to pest (stem borer, armyworm) & diseases (leaf blight).
* Needs irrigation in summer.
* If harvested late → becomes fibrous, less digestible.

---

## 8. Andhra Pradesh Perspective

* Maize is widely grown in AP for **both grain & fodder**.
* Used by dairy farms mainly for **silage preparation**.
* Recommended practice: **Intercropping maize + cowpea** → improves protein.
* APDDCF promotes **silage pits & maize silage making** for year-round feed.

---

## ✅ Summary – Day 49

* Maize = **excellent energy-rich fodder + best for silage**.
* Nutrition: 8–9% protein, 65–70% TDN.
* Harvest: 60–75 days (fodder), 80–90 days (silage).
* Feed: 15–20 kg green/day or silage.
* In AP: focus on **maize silage + cowpea intercrop** for balanced ration.
