<H1>🐄 Day 59: Common Feeding Mistakes.</H1>

Feeding management mistakes are one of the **main reasons for low milk yield, poor fertility, and health problems** in dairy cows.


---

## 1. Over-Reliance on One Type of Feed

❌ Feeding only paddy straw or only green fodder.

* Leads to **imbalanced nutrition** → low milk yield.
  ✅ Solution: Always feed **green + dry + concentrates + minerals**.

---

## 2. Overfeeding or Underfeeding Concentrates

❌ Giving too much concentrate → acidosis, bloat.
❌ Too little → low milk yield.
✅ Rule: **1 kg concentrate per 2.5–3 liters milk** + body maintenance.

---

## 3. Feeding Untreated Low-Quality Straw

❌ Feeding raw paddy straw (very low protein, poor digestibility).
✅ Solution: **Urea treatment or mixing with silage/green fodder**.

---

## 4. Improper Chopping of Fodder

❌ Feeding long fodder → wastage & indigestion.
✅ Chop into **1–2 inch pieces**.

---

## 5. Irregular Feeding Times

❌ Feeding at random hours → stress & poor digestion.
✅ Follow **fixed schedule** (morning, afternoon, evening, night).

---

## 6. Ignoring Water Supply

❌ Not providing enough clean water.

* Reduces feed intake & milk yield.
  ✅ Adult cow needs **60–80 liters/day**, more in summer.

---

## 7. Ignoring Mineral Mixture & Salt

❌ No mineral supplementation → infertility, weak bones, low yield.
✅ Always provide **mineral mixture (50–60 g/day) + salt lick**.

---

## 8. Feeding Moldy or Spoiled Feed

❌ Feeding fungus-infected silage, rotten feed, or wet straw.

* Causes **digestive problems & toxins**.
  ✅ Always check color & smell before feeding.

---

## 9. Not Adjusting for Season

❌ Same ration all year round.

* Summer: cows need more water & electrolytes.
* Monsoon: excess watery grass must be balanced with dry fodder.
* Winter: more concentrates needed for warmth.

---

## 10. Ignoring Individual Needs

❌ Feeding all cows the same ration.

* Pregnant, lactating, and heifers have different requirements.
  ✅ Adjust feeding according to **age, stage of lactation, milk yield**.

---

## 11. Andhra Pradesh Perspective

* **Small farmers** often feed only paddy straw → low yield.
* Many ignore **mineral mixture & salt**.
* Improper storage of silage/hay leads to spoilage.
* Extension programs in AP promote **balanced ration + treated straw + silage**.

---

## ✅ Summary – Day 59

* Common mistakes: **imbalanced ration, poor fodder quality, irregular feeding, lack of water/minerals, ignoring season & individual needs**.
* Correct practices: **balanced ration, chopping, fixed schedule, clean water, minerals, seasonal adjustments**.
* In AP: focus on **reducing paddy-straw-only feeding & improving fodder mix**.
