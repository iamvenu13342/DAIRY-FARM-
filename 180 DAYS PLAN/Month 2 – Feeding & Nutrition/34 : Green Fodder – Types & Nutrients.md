# üêÑ Day 34: Green Fodder ‚Äì Types & Nutrients

---

## 1. Importance of Green Fodder

* Supplies **energy, protein, fiber, vitamins, and minerals**.
* Improves **milk yield and fat %**.
* Cheaper than concentrates ‚Üí reduces feed cost.
* Stimulates **rumination and saliva flow** ‚Üí better digestion.
* Essential in **Andhra Pradesh**, where feed cost is high.

---

## 2. Types of Green Fodder

### **A. Cereal Fodders (Energy-rich)**

* Examples: **Maize, Sorghum (Jowar), Bajra (Pearl millet), Oats**.
* Nutrients: High in **carbohydrates (energy)**, moderate protein.
* Use: Good for **silage making** and bulk feed.

---

### **B. Legume Fodders (Protein-rich)**

* Examples: **Berseem, Lucerne (Alfalfa), Cowpea, Stylo, Pillipesara**.
* Nutrients: **High protein (18‚Äì22%)**, rich in calcium & minerals.
* Use: Improves milk yield, fertility, calf growth.
* Note: Should not be fed in excess ‚Üí risk of bloat.

---

### **C. Perennial / Hybrid Fodders (High-yielding)**

* Examples: **Hybrid Napier (CO-3, CO-4, CO-5), Guinea grass, Para grass**.
* Nutrients: Balanced **fiber + energy**.
* Use: Year-round supply, cut-and-carry system.
* AP farmers widely grow **Hybrid Napier** due to high productivity.

---

### **D. Tree & Shrub Fodders**

* Examples: **Subabul (Leucaena), Sesbania, Moringa (drumstick leaves), Glyricidia**.
* Nutrients: Rich in protein & minerals.
* Use: Supplement to daily ration, especially in lean periods.

---

## 3. Nutrient Contribution of Green Fodder

* **Moisture:** 70‚Äì80% (cools body in hot climate).
* **Protein:**

  * Cereal fodders: 8‚Äì12%
  * Legumes: 18‚Äì22%
* **Fiber:** Maintains rumen health, prevents acidosis.
* **Minerals:** Calcium, phosphorus, magnesium.
* **Vitamins:** A, E, and B-complex (support reproduction & immunity).

---

## 4. Feeding Guidelines

* Adult cow: **25‚Äì30 kg green fodder/day** (40‚Äì50% of total ration).
* Mix cereals + legumes (70:30 ratio) ‚Üí balanced diet.
* Use **silage** to store fodder for lean season (summer).
* Chop fodder (1‚Äì2 inches) ‚Üí increases intake, reduces wastage.

---

## 5. Green Fodder Planning for 50-Cow Farm (AP)

* Daily need: 50 √ó 25 kg = **1,250 kg/day**.
* Monthly need: **\~38 tonnes**.
* Land requirement: \~15‚Äì18 acres of irrigated land (with multi-cut varieties like Napier + cowpea).
* Silage pit: 2‚Äì3 pits of 100 tonnes each for summer season.

## 6. Quick Snapshot

| Fodder Type    | Example Crops               | Main Nutrient     | Best Use                |
| -------------- | --------------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------- |
| **Cereal**     | Maize, Jowar, Bajra         | Energy            | Silage, bulk feed       |
| **Legume**     | Berseem, Lucerne, Cowpea    | Protein, minerals | Milk yield, fertility   |
| **Perennial**  | Hybrid Napier, Guinea grass | Balanced yield    | Year-round supply       |
| **Tree/Shrub** | Subabul, Moringa, Sesbania  | Protein, minerals | Supplement, lean season |

## ‚úÖ Summary ‚Äì Day 34

* Green fodder is **essential for milk yield, cow health, and cost reduction**.
* Types: **Cereal (energy), Legume (protein), Perennial (high yield), Tree/Shrub (supplement)**.
* Adult cow needs **25‚Äì30 kg/day** ‚Üí for 50 cows = \~1,250 kg/day.
* Best strategy: **mix cereals + legumes (70:30) + perennial fodder for year-round supply**.
