<h1>🐄 Day 37 : Mineral Mixture & Salt Licks.</h1>

Though needed in **small amounts**, minerals & salt are **vital for milk yield, fertility, and cow health**.

---


## 1. Importance of Minerals in Dairy Cows

* Essential for **milk production, bone strength, reproduction, and immunity**.
* Deficiency → reduced milk yield, infertility, weak calves, metabolic diseases.
* Minerals cannot be produced by the cow’s body → must come from diet.

---

## 2. Key Minerals Needed

### **A. Macro Minerals (large amounts needed)**

* **Calcium (Ca):** Milk production, bone growth.
* **Phosphorus (P):** Fertility, energy metabolism.
* **Magnesium (Mg):** Prevents grass tetany.
* **Sodium (Na) & Chlorine (Cl):** Nerve function, body fluids.
* **Sulphur (S):** Protein & vitamin synthesis.

### **B. Micro Minerals (trace elements)**

* **Copper (Cu):** Coat color, enzyme activity, fertility.
* **Zinc (Zn):** Hoof health, immunity, reproduction.
* **Manganese (Mn):** Growth, fertility.
* **Cobalt (Co):** Vitamin B12 synthesis.
* **Iodine (I):** Thyroid hormones, growth.
* **Selenium (Se):** Immunity, prevents retained placenta.

## 3. Mineral Mixture

* Balanced powder or granules containing **both macro & micro minerals**.
* Often fortified with vitamins (A, D, E).
* Available commercially as **area-specific mineral mixtures** (APDDCF supplies in Andhra Pradesh).

**Benefits:**
✅ Increases milk yield & fat %.
✅ Improves fertility & reduces repeat breeding.
✅ Healthy calves, strong bones.
✅ Prevents metabolic disorders (milk fever, infertility, mastitis).

**Feeding Guidelines:**

* Adult cow: **50–100 g/day** mixed in feed.
* Pregnant & high-yielding cows need higher supplementation.

---

## 4. Salt Licks (Common Salt – NaCl)

* Cows have a **natural craving for salt**.
* Salt licks are blocks kept in the shed for cows to lick freely.

**Benefits:**
✅ Regulates body fluids & digestion.
✅ Improves appetite & feed intake.
✅ Supplies sodium & chloride (often deficient in fodder).

**Feeding Guidelines:**

* Adult cow: **30–40 g/day**.
* Provide **salt lick blocks** in shed or dissolve salt in drinking water.

---

## 5. Signs of Mineral Deficiency

* Calcium: Milk fever, weak bones, low yield.
* Phosphorus: Repeat breeding, low fertility.
* Copper: Pale coat, infertility.
* Zinc: Cracked hooves, slow healing.
* Iodine: Goitre, weak calves.
* Selenium: Retained placenta, weak immunity.

---

## 6. Andhra Pradesh Perspective

* Soils in AP often **deficient in phosphorus & zinc**.
* APDDCF & government supply **mineral mixture at subsidized rates**.
* Farmers should **regularly mix mineral mixture in concentrates** + provide **salt lick blocks** in sheds.

---

## ✅ Summary – Day 37

* Minerals are **small but powerful nutrients**.
* **Mineral Mixture (50–100 g/day):** Boosts milk yield, fertility, health.
* **Salt Licks (30–40 g/day):** Maintain appetite, fluids, digestion.
* Deficiency leads to **low yield, infertility, weak calves, metabolic problems**.
* In AP → always use **area-specific mineral mixture + salt lick block**.
