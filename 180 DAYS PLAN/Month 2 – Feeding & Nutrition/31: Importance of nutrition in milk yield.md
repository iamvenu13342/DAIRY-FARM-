<H1>Day 31 Notes: Importance of Nutrition in Milk Yield</H1>

***Nutrition is the **biggest factor** that affects milk production, fertility, and cow health.***

# 🐄 Day 31: Importance of Nutrition in Milk Yield

---

## 1. Why Nutrition Matters

* Milk is produced from **nutrients absorbed from feed**.
* Poor feeding → low milk, poor fertility, health problems.
* Proper feeding → higher yield, better fat %, healthy calves.

👉 Feed = **60–70% of total operating cost**, so efficiency is crucial.

## 2. Nutritional Needs of Dairy Cows

### **A. Energy**

* Source: Carbohydrates (maize, sorghum, silage) & fats (oil cakes).
* Needed for **milk synthesis, body maintenance, and fertility**.
* Energy shortage → drop in milk yield, weight loss, delayed heat.

### **B. Protein**

* Source: Oil cakes (groundnut, cottonseed, soybean), legume fodders.
* Needed for **milk protein, muscle repair, reproduction**.
* Low protein → low yield, weak calves.

### **C. Fiber**

* Source: Green & dry fodder (maize stover, straw).
* Maintains **rumen health, cud chewing, digestion**.
* Too little fiber → acidosis, low-fat milk.

### **D. Minerals**

* **Calcium & Phosphorus**: Bone growth, milk production.
* **Magnesium**: Prevents grass tetany.
* **Trace minerals (Zn, Cu, Mn, Se, I)**: Fertility, immunity, growth.

### **E. Vitamins**

* Vitamin A: Eye & reproductive health.
* Vitamin D: Calcium absorption.
* Vitamin E: Immunity & fertility.

### **F. Water**

* Milk = 85–87% water.
* Cow needs **60–120 liters/day**.
* Even mild water shortage = ↓ feed intake, ↓ milk yield.

## 3. Feeding Management for High Yield

* **Balanced Ration:** Mix of green fodder, dry fodder, concentrates, minerals.
* **Feeding Frequency:** 2–3 times/day, fresh feed after milking.
* **TMR (Total Mixed Ration):** Mix all feed → prevents selective eating.
* **By-Products:** Use oil cakes, molasses, distillers’ grains to reduce cost.
* **Mineral Mixture & Salt lick:** Always available.

---

## 4. Nutrition & Lactation Cycle

* **Early Lactation:** High energy & protein (to support peak milk).
* **Mid Lactation:** Balanced diet to maintain yield & prepare for breeding.
* **Late Lactation:** More fiber, support fetal growth.
* **Dry Period:** Good minerals & vitamins → prepare udder for next lactation.

---

## 5. Role in Milk Quality

* Energy & protein → affect **milk volume & protein content**.
* Fiber → affects **milk fat %**.
* Minerals (Ca, P) → needed for **high yield and strong bones in calves**.
* Water → directly linked to **total milk output**.

---

## 6. Andhra Pradesh Perspective

* Use **local green fodders**: maize, sorghum, hybrid napier, groundnut haulm.
* Silage preparation before summer.
* Rice straw (dry fodder) is abundant → mix with protein-rich concentrates.
* Always provide **mineral mixture** (subsidized under AP Dairy schemes).

---

## ✅ Summary – Day 31

* Nutrition is the **key driver of milk yield**.
* Needs: **Energy, protein, fiber, minerals, vitamins, and plenty of water**.
* Balanced ration = **higher milk yield, better fertility, healthy cows & calves**.
* In AP, focus on **green fodder + silage + rice straw + concentrates + mineral mix**.
