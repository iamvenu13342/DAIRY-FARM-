<H1>🐄 Day 50: Fodder Crop – Sorghum.</H1>

Sorghum (*Sorghum bicolor*) is a **high-yielding, drought-tolerant cereal fodder crop**, widely cultivated in **Andhra Pradesh** for dairy cattle.



---

## 1. Introduction

* Scientific name: *Sorghum bicolor*.
* Also called **Jowar (జొన్న in Telugu)**.
* Can be used as **green fodder, dry stover, and silage**.
* Very suitable for **hot & dry regions** → common in AP Rayalaseema districts.

---

## 2. Advantages of Sorghum Fodder

✅ **Drought-tolerant** → grows with less irrigation.
✅ **High yield**: 200–250 quintals green fodder/acre/year.
✅ **Nutritious**: Good source of energy & fiber.
✅ **Multiple cuts possible** (depending on variety).
✅ Suitable for **silage making**.

## 3. Nutritional Value (per 100 kg green fodder)

* Dry Matter: 20–25 kg.
* Crude Protein: 7–10%.
* Total Digestible Nutrients (TDN): 55–60%.
* Calcium: 0.3%.
* Phosphorus: 0.25%.
  👉 Provides **energy & fiber**, but protein is lower compared to legumes.

---

## 4. Varieties for Fodder

* **Pusa Chari, MP Chari, HC-171, CSH-9**.
* Multicut hybrids: **COFS-29, COFS-31**.
* Local AP varieties: widely grown in **Anantapur, Kurnool** regions.

---

## 5. Cultivation Practices

* **Soil:** Well-drained sandy loam to loamy soils.
* **Season:** Mainly **Kharif & Rabi**; summer under irrigation.
* **Sowing:** 3–4 kg seed/acre.
* **Spacing:** 30 × 15 cm (single cut) or 30 × 30 cm (multi-cut).
* **Fertilizer:** 40–50 kg Nitrogen/acre (split dose).
* **Irrigation:** Requires less water than maize/Napier.
* **Harvesting:**

  * For fodder: At **50% flowering (60–70 days)**.
  * For silage: At **soft dough stage (80–90 days)**.

---

## 6. Feeding Guidelines

* Feed **15–20 kg green sorghum/cow/day**.
* Always **chop into 1–2 inch pieces** before feeding.
* Best fed mixed with legume fodder (cowpea, lucerne) → balances protein.
* **Caution:** Do not feed **young sorghum (<40 days)** → may contain **hydrocyanic acid (HCN)**, toxic to cattle.

---

## 7. Challenges

* **HCN poisoning** risk in young plants or drought-stressed sorghum.
* Low protein → must be mixed with legumes.
* Pest attack: shoot fly, stem borer.
* If harvested late → coarse & less digestible.

---

## 8. Andhra Pradesh Perspective

* Sorghum is a **traditional fodder crop in Rayalaseema** (Anantapur, Kurnool).
* Favored for its **drought tolerance** in rainfed areas.
* Used as **green fodder + stover for storage**.
* Farmers advised to **avoid young sorghum feeding** to prevent poisoning.
* APDDCF promotes **maize + sorghum silage** to ensure year-round supply.

---

## ✅ Summary – Day 50

* Sorghum = **drought-tolerant, high-yielding fodder crop**.
* Nutrition: 7–10% protein, 55–60% TDN.
* Feed: 15–20 kg/cow/day, chopped.
* Harvest: 60–70 days (fodder), 80–90 days (silage).
* Caution: **Do not feed <40 days crop** (HCN risk).
* In AP: key crop for **rainfed fodder security**.
