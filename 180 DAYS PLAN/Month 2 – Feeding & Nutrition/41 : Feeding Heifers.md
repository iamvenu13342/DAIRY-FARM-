<h1>🐄 Day 41 Notes: Feeding Heifers.</h1>

Heifers = **young female calves (3 months – first calving)**. Their nutrition is vital because **today’s heifers are tomorrow’s dairy cows**.

#  Day 41: Feeding Heifers

---

## 1. Importance

* Proper heifer feeding ensures:
  ✅ Healthy growth & weight gain.
  ✅ Early maturity & timely first calving (24–30 months).
  ✅ Strong bones, udder development, fertility.
  ✅ Higher milk yield after calving.

---

## 2. Growth Targets for Heifers

* **Birth weight (calf):** 25–30 kg.
* **At 6 months:** 60–70 kg.
* **At 12 months:** 120–130 kg.
* **At 24 months (first calving):** 280–320 kg (depends on breed).

---

## 3. Feeding Stages

### **A. 3–6 Months (Early Heifer Stage)**

* Diet: Good quality calf starter (1–1.5 kg/day) + green fodder + dry fodder.
* Focus: Rumen development, steady growth.
* Provide mineral mixture & salt daily.

### **B. 6–12 Months (Growing Stage)**

* Green fodder: 10–15 kg/day.
* Dry fodder: 3–4 kg/day.
* Concentrates: 1–2 kg/day (protein-rich).
* Water: 25–40 liters/day.
* Focus: Bone & muscle growth.

### **C. 12–24 Months (Breeding Stage)**

* Green fodder: 15–20 kg/day.
* Dry fodder: 4–5 kg/day.
* Concentrates: 2–3 kg/day (oil cakes, grains).
* Water: 40–60 liters/day.
* Special care during last 3 months of pregnancy (see Day 24 maternity notes).

---

## 4. Nutritional Balance for Heifers

* **Energy:** Maize, sorghum, barley → growth.
* **Protein:** Groundnut cake, soybean meal → muscle & udder development.
* **Fiber:** Paddy/wheat straw → rumen health.
* **Minerals & Vitamins:** For bones, fertility, calf development.
* **Salt & Water:** Must be available freely.

---

## 5. Feeding Guidelines

* Avoid **overfeeding concentrates** → leads to fatty heifers, poor udder development.
* Provide **balanced ration**: 60% fodder + 40% concentrates.
* Feed at **regular timings**.
* Provide **exercise area (open paddock)** → prevents obesity & improves fertility.
* Deworm & vaccinate regularly (parasites reduce growth).

---

## 6. Andhra Pradesh Perspective

* Heifers often underfed due to focus on lactating cows.
* Common practice: feeding only paddy straw → leads to stunted growth & delayed maturity.
* Farmers should:
  ✅ Grow **legume fodder (cowpea, stylo, lucerne)**.
  ✅ Provide **2–3 kg concentrate mix** daily after 12 months.
  ✅ Ensure mineral mixture (subsidized by APDDCF).

---

## 7. Example Daily Diet for a 12–18 Month Heifer (AP Farm)

* Green fodder: 12–15 kg.
* Dry fodder: 4 kg (treated paddy straw).
* Concentrate: 2 kg (maize 40%, oil cake 40%, bran 20%).
* Mineral mixture: 50 g.
* Salt: 20 g.
* Water: 40–50 liters.

---

## ✅ Summary – Day 41

* Heifers need **balanced growth** (not too thin, not too fat).
* Target: **Calving at 24–30 months** with body weight \~300 kg.
* Diet: Green + dry fodder + 1–3 kg concentrates + minerals + water.
* In AP → avoid only straw feeding, use **legume fodder & concentrate supplements**.
* Healthy heifer = **future high-yield dairy cow**.
