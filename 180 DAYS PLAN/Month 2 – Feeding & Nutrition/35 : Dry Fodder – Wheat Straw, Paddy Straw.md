 <h1>🐄 Day 35 Notes: Dry Fodder – Wheat Straw, Paddy Straw.</h1>
 
Dry fodder is the **most widely used feed** for dairy cows in India, especially in Andhra Pradesh.

---



## 1. Importance of Dry Fodder

* Provides **bulk & fiber** in cow diet.
* Essential for **rumen function, cud chewing, and saliva production**.
* Maintains **milk fat %**.
* Easily available year-round → staple feed in Indian dairy farms.
* Cheaper than concentrates.

---

## 2. Types of Dry Fodder

### **A. Wheat Straw (Bhoosa)**

* By-product of wheat crop.
* Color: Golden yellow, soft, leafy.
* Nutritional value:

  * Crude Protein: **3–4%**
  * Fiber: **30–35%**
  * More digestible than paddy straw.
* Advantages:
  ✅ Softer, more palatable.
  ✅ Better nutrient availability.
* Limitation: Less available in Andhra Pradesh (mainly in north India).

---

### **B. Paddy Straw (Pulla, Parali)**

* By-product of rice crop (abundant in Andhra Pradesh).
* Color: Pale yellow, coarse, silica-rich.
* Nutritional value:

  * Crude Protein: **2–3%**
  * Fiber: **35–40%**
  * Low digestibility due to high silica.
* Advantages:
  ✅ Very cheap & easily available in AP.
  ✅ Can be stored for long periods.
* Limitation:
  ❌ Poor digestibility.
  ❌ Deficient in protein & minerals.
  ❌ Needs **urea treatment or supplementation** for better use.

## 3. Nutrient Contribution of Dry Fodder

* **Moisture:** 8–12% (low → easy storage).
* **Fiber:** Maintains rumen health & milk fat.
* **Protein:** Very low (2–4%) → must be balanced with legumes/concentrates.
* **Minerals:** Deficient in calcium & phosphorus.

---

## 4. Feeding Guidelines

* Adult cow needs **6–8 kg dry fodder/day**.
* Should form **30–35% of total ration**.
* Feed along with **green fodder + concentrates** for balance.
* Paddy straw should always be fed with **protein supplements/mineral mixture**.
* **Urea treatment of paddy straw (urea 4% + water + 21 days storage):** Increases protein content to 8–9%.

---

## 5. Storage of Dry Fodder

* Store in **dry, well-ventilated sheds**.
* Stack above ground (on bamboo/wooden platform) → avoid moisture.
* Protect from termites & rodents.
* Cover with polythene sheets during rainy season.

## 6. Quick Comparison

| Parameter     | Wheat Straw | Paddy Straw                |
| ------------- | ----------- | -------------------------- |
| Protein (%)   | 3–4%        | 2–3%                       |
| Fiber (%)     | 30–35%      | 35–40%                     |
| Digestibility | Better      | Poor                       |
| Availability  | Less in AP  | High in AP                 |
| Use           | Direct feed | Needs treatment/supplement |

---

## 7. Andhra Pradesh Perspective

* Paddy straw = **most common dry fodder** (cheap & abundant).
* Farmers should adopt **urea treatment or mix with legume fodder** to improve nutrition.
* Wheat straw is better nutritionally but limited availability → more costly in AP.

---

## ✅ Summary – Day 35

* Dry fodder = **cheap, available year-round, maintains fiber balance**.
* **Wheat straw:** Softer, better quality, but less available in AP.
* **Paddy straw:** Abundant in AP, but poor digestibility → needs supplementation or urea treatment.
* Adult cow needs **6–8 kg/day**, always fed with green fodder & concentrates.
