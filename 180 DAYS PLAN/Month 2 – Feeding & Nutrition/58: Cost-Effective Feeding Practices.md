## 1. Why Focus on Cost-Effective Feeding?

* Feed = **biggest cost** in milk production.
* Balanced but economical feeding ensures:
  ✅ Lower expenses.
  ✅ Better milk yield.
  ✅ Improved animal health.
  ✅ Higher farm profit.

## 2. Strategies for Cost-Effective Feeding

### **A. Grow Own Fodder**

* Cultivate **Napier, maize, sorghum, cowpea** instead of buying.
* Saves 30–40% cost.
* Use **intercropping (Maize + Cowpea)** for balanced nutrition.

### **B. Use Crop Residues Wisely**

* Paddy straw, maize stover, groundnut haulms.
* Improve quality via **urea treatment, chopping, or mixing with molasses**.

### **C. Preserve Surplus Fodder**

* Make **silage from maize/sorghum** in monsoon.
* Prepare **hay from cowpea/lucerne**.
* Ensures cheap feed during lean summer months.

### **D. Balanced Ration**

* Avoid overfeeding concentrates (expensive).
* Follow thumb rule: **1 kg concentrate per 2.5–3 liters of milk**.
* Provide **mineral mixture + salt lick** to avoid costly deficiencies.

### **E. Reduce Feed Wastage**

* Chop fodder into **1–2 inch pieces**.
* Use **trough feeding** instead of floor feeding.
* Store silage/hay properly to prevent spoilage.

### **F. Seasonal Feeding Adjustments**

* Summer: Feed silage + green fodder in cool hours.
* Monsoon: Avoid excess watery grass → mix with dry fodder.
* Winter: Increase concentrates for energy.

### **G. Use By-products**

* Oil cakes (groundnut, cottonseed, soybean).
* Bran, molasses, brewery waste (where available).
* Cheaper sources of energy & protein.

## 3. Special Practices in Andhra Pradesh

* **Paddy belt (Krishna, Godavari districts):** Urea-treated paddy straw + Napier.
* **Rayalaseema (drought-prone):** Silage + sorghum + groundnut haulms.
* **Commercial dairies:** Bulk silage pits + TMR (Total Mixed Ration) for accuracy.
* **Small farmers:** Community silage & fodder block projects supported by APDDCF.

## 4. Golden Rules for Cost-Saving

✅ Grow your own fodder → reduces dependence on market.
✅ Mix **green + dry + concentrates** in proper ratio.
✅ Use crop residues with treatment.
✅ Preserve fodder for lean months.
✅ Avoid feed wastage → chop & feed properly.
✅ Supplement with minerals → prevents costly diseases.

## ✅ Summary – Day 58

* Cost-effective feeding = **balancing quality & expense**.
* Main practices: grow fodder, use residues, make silage/hay, feed balanced ration, reduce wastage, use by-products.
* In AP: focus on **Napier, maize silage, paddy straw treatment, and community silage**.
* Smart feeding cuts costs by **20–30%** and increases farm profit.
