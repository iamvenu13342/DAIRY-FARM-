<H1>🐄 Day 44: Feeding Pregnant Cows.</H1>

Pregnancy feeding is crucial because it affects both the **health of the cow** and the **growth of the unborn calf**.


---

## 1. Importance

* Provides nutrients for **fetal growth** (especially last 3 months).
* Prepares cow for **calving & next lactation**.
* Prevents calving difficulties, weak calves, and metabolic diseases.
* Improves **fertility and milk yield** after calving.

---

## 2. Nutritional Needs of Pregnant Cows

* **Energy:** Moderate (avoid over-conditioning/fat cows).

  * Sources: Maize, sorghum, barley, rice bran.
* **Protein:** Required for calf growth & udder tissue development.

  * Sources: Oil cakes (groundnut, soybean), legumes.
* **Fiber:** Essential for rumen health.

  * Sources: Paddy straw, hay, silage.
* **Minerals & Vitamins:**

  * Calcium, phosphorus, magnesium for bones.
  * Selenium, iodine, vitamin E for calf immunity & placenta health.
* **Water:** 50–70 liters/day (increases towards late pregnancy).

---

## 3. Balanced Ration Formula (AP Example)

### **For a 400 kg Pregnant Cow (last trimester)**

* Green fodder: 15–20 kg (maize, Napier, cowpea, lucerne).
* Dry fodder: 5–6 kg (paddy straw, preferably urea-treated).
* Concentrates: 2–3 kg (maize 40%, oil cake 40%, bran 20%).
* Mineral mixture: 75–100 g/day.
* Salt: 30 g/day.
* Water: 60 L.

## 4. Feeding Strategy

### **Early Pregnancy (0–6 months)**

* Normal adult cow ration (maintenance + growth).
* Do not overfeed concentrates.
* Focus on fodder (green + dry).

### **Late Pregnancy (7–9 months)**

* Fetus grows rapidly → **70–80% of calf growth happens now**.
* Increase **protein & minerals** in diet.
* Add **2–3 kg concentrates/day**.
* Ensure vitamins A, D, E supplementation.
* Avoid excess calcium before calving (reduces risk of milk fever).

---

## 5. Special Precautions

* Prevent **obesity** → leads to calving difficulties.
* Always provide **clean water** (pregnant cows drink more).
* Vaccinate (FMD, HS, BQ) during mid-pregnancy.
* Deworm in 6–7 months of pregnancy.
* Avoid feeding spoiled or moldy fodder (causes abortion).
* Shift cow to **maternity pen** 2–3 weeks before expected calving.

---

## 6. Andhra Pradesh Perspective

* Farmers often feed only straw during pregnancy → leads to weak calves & poor milk yield.
* Recommended:
  ✅ Urea-treated paddy straw + green fodder (Napier, maize, cowpea).
  ✅ 2–3 kg concentrate mix daily in last trimester.
  ✅ Area-specific mineral mixture supplied by APDDCF.
  ✅ Shade, water, and comfortable housing.

## 7. Quick Snapshot

| Stage          | Diet Focus                | Concentrates |
| -------------- | ------------------------- | ------------ |
| Early (0–6 mo) | Maintenance + growth      | Minimal      |
| Late (7–9 mo)  | Fetal growth + udder prep | 2–3 kg/day   |

---

## ✅ Summary – Day 44

* Pregnant cows need **balanced nutrition for calf & future lactation**.
* Early pregnancy → normal ration.
* Late pregnancy → **higher protein, minerals, 2–3 kg concentrates**.
* In AP: use **paddy straw (treated) + Napier/maize + oil cakes + mineral mix**.
* Healthy feeding = **easy calving, strong calf, high milk yield**.
