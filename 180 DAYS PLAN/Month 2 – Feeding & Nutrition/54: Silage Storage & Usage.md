After preparing silage, **proper storage & feeding practices** are critical to maintain quality and avoid losses.

## 1. Storage Structures

### **A. Pit/Trench Silos**

* Dug in the ground, lined with plastic sheet.
* Most common in **Andhra Pradesh** (low-cost option).

### **B. Bunker Silos**

* Above-ground, walled structure.
* Suitable for **large farms & community projects**.

### **C. Tower Silos**

* Vertical structures, common in developed countries.
* Rare in India due to high cost.

### **D. Bag Silage (New Method)**

* Chopped fodder filled in **polythene bags (500 kg–1 ton)**.
* Portable, used in small farms or commercial sales.

## 2. Storage Guidelines

* Always **chop fodder (1–2 inches)** before storage.
* Fill silo in **1–2 days maximum** to prevent spoilage.
* Compact layer by layer → remove oxygen.
* Use **plastic sheet cover + soil/mud** → airtight seal.
* Place **stones/weights** to keep sheet tight.
* Protect from **rainwater entry & rodents**.

## 3. Silage Quality Check

* Good Silage:
  ✅ Yellowish-green color.
  ✅ Pleasant fruity smell (vinegar/jaggery).
  ✅ Moist, not slimy.
  ✅ pH 4.0–4.5.

* Bad Silage:
  ❌ Black, moldy, rotten smell.
  ❌ Too wet or too dry.
  ❌ Fungal growth.
  ❌ Causes indigestion/health issues in cows.

## 4. Usage (Feeding Practices)

* Open pit **from one side only** → prevents air entry.
* Remove daily requirement only, cover remaining tightly.
* Feed **10–15 kg silage/day per adult cow**.
* Always mix with **dry fodder + concentrates** for balanced ration.
* Introduce gradually (3–4 days) if cow has never eaten silage.
* Avoid feeding **spoiled or moldy silage**.

## 5. Silage in Andhra Pradesh

* APDDCF promotes **village-level silage bunkers & bag silage projects**.
* Popular in **Rayalaseema & coastal drought-prone areas**.
* Farmers adopting **maize silage + Napier silage**.
* Commercial silage bags are sold to small dairy farmers.

## 6. Advantages of Good Storage & Usage

✅ Year-round fodder security.
✅ Consistent milk yield.
✅ Lower feed cost (less dependency on concentrates).
✅ Reduces fodder wastage.

---

## ✅ Summary – Day 54

* Silage storage structures: **pit, bunker, tower, bag silage**.
* Key = **airtight, compact, moisture-balanced** storage.
* Feeding: **10–15 kg/cow/day**, always with other fodder.
* In Andhra Pradesh: **maize silage pits & commercial bag silage** are becoming popular.
* Good storage & usage → ensures **nutritious feed, steady milk production, and lower costs**.
