<H1>🐄 Day 48: Fodder Crop – Napier Grass.</H1>

Napier grass (also called **elephant grass**) is one of the **most important fodder crops** for dairy farms in Andhra Pradesh and across India.

## 1. Introduction

* Scientific name: *Pennisetum purpureum*.
* Common names: **Elephant grass, Hybrid Napier**.
* Tall, perennial fodder crop grown in tropical/subtropical regions.
* Very popular in **Andhra Pradesh** due to **high yield and year-round supply**.

---

## 2. Varieties (High-yielding hybrids)

* **CO-3, CO-4, CO-5** (Tamil Nadu Agricultural University varieties).
* **APBN-1** (Andhra Pradesh variety).
* **IGFRI hybrids** (from Indian Grassland and Fodder Research Institute).

## 3. Advantages of Napier Grass

✅ **High yield**: 250–300 tonnes green fodder/acre/year (multi-cut).
✅ **Perennial crop**: lasts 3–4 years once planted.
✅ **Nutritious**: 8–12% crude protein, high digestibility.
✅ **Fast-growing**: first cut in 60–75 days, later every 45–50 days.
✅ **Suitable for silage** making.
✅ Resistant to drought (with irrigation support).

## 4. Nutritional Value (per 100 kg green fodder)

* Dry Matter: 20–25 kg.
* Crude Protein: 8–12%.
* Total Digestible Nutrients (TDN): 55–60%.
* Calcium: 0.3–0.4%.
* Phosphorus: 0.2–0.25%.
* Provides **energy + moderate protein** → good for milk yield.

---

## 5. Cultivation Practices

* **Land & Soil:** Well-drained loamy soil, pH 5.5–8.0.
* **Propagation:** Stem cuttings or root slips (not from seeds).
* **Planting:** 2 rows × 60 cm apart, stem cuttings planted 10–15 cm deep.
* **Fertilizer:** Requires nitrogen for high yield (apply urea after each cut).
* **Irrigation:** Regular watering every 10–15 days (more frequent in summer).
* **Harvesting:** First cut at 60–75 days, later cuts every 45–50 days.

---

## 6. Feeding Guidelines

* Chop into 1–2 inch pieces before feeding.
* Feed **20–25 kg per adult cow per day** (part of ration).
* Mix with legume fodder (cowpea, lucerne) → improves protein balance.
* Suitable for **silage preparation** for summer use.

---

## 7. Challenges

* If harvested late → becomes coarse, less digestible.
* Needs irrigation (not suitable for completely rainfed areas).
* High fertilizer demand (nitrogen).
* Must chop before feeding → otherwise wastage.

---

## 8. Andhra Pradesh Perspective

* Napier grass is the **most widely grown fodder crop** in AP.
* Used in **cut-and-carry system** (no grazing).
* Recommended variety: **CO-3/CO-4 + cowpea intercrop** for balanced fodder.
* Farmers encouraged by **APDDCF** to grow Napier for reducing feed costs.

---

## ✅ Summary – Day 48

* Napier grass = **backbone of dairy fodder** in AP.
* Benefits: **High yield (250–300 t/acre), perennial, good nutrition (8–12% protein)**.
* Needs **irrigation & nitrogen fertilizer**.
* Best fed chopped + mixed with legumes.
* Helps in **silage making & year-round green fodder supply**.
