<H1>🐄 Day 55: Urea Treatment of Straw.</H1>

This is a **low-cost method** to improve the **nutritional value of poor-quality crop residues** (like paddy/wheat straw), which are commonly fed to dairy cows in Andhra Pradesh.

## 1. Why Treat Straw with Urea?

* Paddy/wheat straw = **very low in protein (2–3%)** & poor digestibility.
* Leads to **low milk yield & poor body condition**.
* Treating with **urea (4%)**:
  ✅ Increases protein content (up to 8–9%).
  ✅ Improves digestibility.
  ✅ Increases intake & palatability.
  ✅ Reduces dependence on costly concentrates.

## 2. Materials Needed

* Paddy or wheat straw (dry, chopped preferred).
* Urea (commercial fertilizer grade).
* Clean water.
* Polythene sheet or airtight storage structure.

---

## 3. Treatment Procedure

### **Step 1: Prepare Urea Solution**

* Dissolve **4 kg urea in 100 liters of water**.
* This solution is enough for treating **100 kg dry straw**.

### **Step 2: Layering & Sprinkling**

* Spread 10–15 cm thick layer of straw.
* Sprinkle urea solution evenly on it.
* Repeat layer by layer until all straw is treated.

### **Step 3: Stacking & Covering**

* Pile the treated straw in a heap or pit.
* Press tightly to remove air.
* Cover with **polythene sheet** to make it airtight.

### **Step 4: Fermentation**

* Leave the heap for **2–3 weeks in summer** or **3–4 weeks in winter**.
* Urea breaks down → releases ammonia → improves protein & digestibility.

### **Step 5: Feeding**

* Open heap, allow treated straw to **air for 1–2 hours** (to remove excess ammonia smell).
* Feed directly to cattle.

## 4. Feeding Guidelines

* **Daily allowance:** 6–8 kg per adult cow/day (as part of ration).
* Always mix with **green fodder + concentrates**.
* Do not feed more than 50% of ration as treated straw.
* Introduce gradually over 4–5 days.

---

## 5. Safety Precautions

* Do not feed immediately after treatment → risk of ammonia toxicity.
* Never use more than **4–5% urea**.
* Avoid using **moldy or wet straw**.
* Pregnant cows & young calves → limit feeding.

---

## 6. Andhra Pradesh Perspective

* **Paddy straw is abundant** in Krishna, Guntur, Nellore, East & West Godavari districts.
* Traditionally fed untreated → poor productivity.
* **APDDCF & NABARD** promote **urea treatment pits** at village level.
* Many progressive farmers are adopting **treated straw + Napier/maize silage** for balanced feeding.

## 7. Benefits of Urea-Treated Straw

✅ Increases **protein content (3% → 8–9%)**.
✅ Improves digestibility by 10–15%.
✅ Cows eat more & produce more milk.
✅ Low-cost, farmer-friendly technology.
✅ Reduces feed shortages in **lean seasons**.

---

## ✅ Summary – Day 55

* Urea treatment = **simple method to improve poor-quality straw**.
* Method: **4 kg urea + 100 L water → 100 kg straw → airtight stack (2–3 weeks)**.
* Feeding: **6–8 kg/day/cow**, always mixed with green fodder & concentrates.
* In Andhra Pradesh: crucial in **paddy belt districts** for reducing feed costs & increasing milk yield.
