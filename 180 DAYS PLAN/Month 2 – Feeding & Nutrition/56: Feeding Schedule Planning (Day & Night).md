## 1. Importance of Feeding Schedule

* Cows are **creatures of habit** → they eat better if fed at fixed times.
* Regular schedule ensures:
  ✅ Maximum feed intake.
  ✅ Good digestion & rumen health.
  ✅ Stable milk yield & fat %.
  ✅ Reduced feed wastage.

---

## 2. General Principles

* Split feeding into **2–3 meals/day**.
* Feed **during cool hours** (early morning & evening), especially in **summer**.
* Always provide **clean water & salt lick** along with feed.
* Order of feeding:
  1️⃣ Green fodder → 2️⃣ Dry fodder → 3️⃣ Concentrates.
* Milking should be **before feeding concentrates** for best milk letdown.

## 3. Example Daily Feeding Schedule (For Andhra Pradesh Dairy Farms)

### **Morning (5–7 AM)**

* Clean water available.
* **Green fodder (50% of daily allowance)**.
* **Half concentrates** (based on milk yield).
* Milking immediately after feeding concentrates.

### **Midday (12–1 PM)**

* **Dry fodder (1/3 of daily allowance)**.
* Fresh water.
* Shade/rest period (important in hot climate).

### **Evening (5–7 PM)**

* **Remaining green fodder + dry fodder**.
* **Remaining concentrates**.
* Milking again.

### **Night (9–10 PM)**

* Provide **small amount of dry fodder** (keeps rumen active).
* Ensure water availability.

## 4. Concentrate Feeding Rule

* **1 kg concentrate per 2.5–3 liters of milk yield**.
* High-yielding cows → split concentrates into **3 feedings/day**.

---

## 5. Special Feeding Adjustments

* **Summer:** Feed more during **early morning & evening**; avoid peak heat hours.
* **Pregnant cows:** Provide extra protein & minerals during evening feeding.
* **Calves & heifers:** Feed separately, smaller portions more often.
* **Silage users:** Feed silage in **evening** (cooler, better intake).

---

## 6. Andhra Pradesh Perspective

* Many farmers traditionally feed only **once or twice/day**, causing indigestion & low yield.
* Recommended:
  ✅ 2–3 feeding times (morning + evening + night).
  ✅ Use **cut-and-carry Napier/maize/cowpea mix**.
  ✅ Provide **silage in evening** during lean season.
  ✅ Ensure **water troughs near feeding area**.

---

## ✅ Summary – Day 56

* Feeding must follow a **fixed day & night schedule**.
* Example:

  * Morning: green fodder + half concentrates.
  * Midday: dry fodder.
  * Evening: green + dry + remaining concentrates.
  * Night: small dry fodder.
* Rule: **Fodder first, concentrates later, water always available**.
* In Andhra Pradesh: **2–3 meals/day** with more feeding in cool hours is best.
