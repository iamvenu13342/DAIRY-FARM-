<h1>🐄 Day 39 Notes: Balanced Ration Formula.</h1>

Balanced ration = **right mix of green fodder, dry fodder, concentrates, minerals & water** to meet a cow’s daily needs.

#  Day 39: Balanced Ration Formula

---

## 1. What is a Balanced Ration?

* A feed mixture that provides **all nutrients (energy, protein, fiber, minerals, vitamins, water)** in correct proportions.
* Ensures:

  * Higher **milk yield & fat %**.
  * Better fertility & calf growth.
  * Healthy digestion & disease resistance.
  * Cost-effective feeding.

---

## 2. Key Components of Balanced Ration

### **A. Green Fodder (40–50%)**

* Energy + vitamins + minerals.
* Example: Maize, Sorghum, Napier, Berseem.
* Quantity: **20–25 kg/day per cow**.

### **B. Dry Fodder (30–35%)**

* Fiber for rumen health.
* Example: Paddy straw, wheat straw.
* Quantity: **6–8 kg/day per cow**.

### **C. Concentrates (20–25%)**

* Protein + energy for milk yield.
* Example: Oil cakes (groundnut, soybean), maize, wheat bran, rice bran.
* Rule: **1 kg concentrate for every 2.5–3 L milk produced**.

### **D. Mineral Mixture & Salt**

* 50–100 g/day mineral mixture.
* 30–40 g/day common salt (or salt lick).

### **E. Water**

* 60–120 L/day per cow (depending on yield & season).

## 3. Sample Balanced Ration (Per Day, for 15 L Milk Cow in AP)

* **Green fodder:** 20 kg (maize/napier + legume mix).
* **Dry fodder:** 6 kg (paddy straw, treated if possible).
* **Concentrate mixture:** 5–6 kg (maize, groundnut cake, rice bran, wheat bran).
* **Mineral mixture:** 75 g.
* **Salt:** 30 g.
* **Water:** 80–100 liters.

---

## 4. Concentrate Mixture Example Formula (100 kg mix)

* Maize / broken rice → 35 kg (energy).
* Groundnut cake / soybean meal → 25 kg (protein).
* Wheat bran → 20 kg (fiber + protein).
* Rice bran → 15 kg (energy + fat).
* Mineral mixture → 2.5 kg.
* Salt → 2.5 kg.

👉 This mix balances **protein (16–18%)** and energy for lactating cows.

---

## 5. Feeding Schedule

* **Morning:** Half green fodder + half concentrates + water.
* **Afternoon:** Dry fodder + remaining concentrates.
* **Evening:** Remaining green fodder + water.
* Always feed **fodder first, then concentrates** → prevents acidosis.

---

## 6. Benefits of Balanced Ration

✅ Increases milk yield by **10–15%**.
✅ Improves **milk fat & SNF %**.
✅ Reduces feeding cost per liter of milk.
✅ Prevents problems (acidosis, ketosis, infertility).
✅ Ensures healthy calves & longer cow lifespan.

---

## 7. Andhra Pradesh Perspective

* Fodder base: **Paddy straw + maize/napier + groundnut cake + rice bran**.
* Use **urea-treated paddy straw** to improve protein.
* APDDCF & NABARD promote **“Ration Balancing Programme (RBP)”** with trained village nutrition advisors.

---

## ✅ Summary – Day 39

* Balanced ration = **Green fodder (40–50%) + Dry fodder (30–35%) + Concentrates (20–25%) + Minerals + Salt + Water**.
* Example (15 L milk cow): 20 kg green, 6 kg straw, 5–6 kg concentrates, 75 g minerals, 30 g salt, 80–100 L water.
* Benefits: **Higher yield, better fertility, cost efficiency**.
* In AP → focus on **paddy straw + maize + groundnut cake + bran + mineral mix**.
