<H1>🐄 Day 84: Waste Disposal Impact on Health.</H1>

Proper waste management is essential to maintain **cow health, human health, and environmental safety**.

## 1. Types of Dairy Farm Waste

* **Dung (solid waste)** – produced daily in large quantity.
* **Urine (liquid waste)** – high in nitrogen, strong odor.
* **Wastewater** – from washing sheds, equipment.
* **Dead animals / placenta** – biological waste.
* **Biomedical waste** – syringes, medicine bottles.

## 2. Health Hazards of Poor Waste Disposal

### **A. Animal Health**

❌ Wet & dirty sheds → mastitis, foot rot, pneumonia.
❌ Manure heaps → breeding ground for flies, ticks, mosquitoes.
❌ Contaminated water → diarrhea, liver fluke infestation.

### **B. Human Health**

❌ Spread of zoonotic diseases (Brucellosis, TB, Leptospirosis).
❌ Foul odor → respiratory irritation.
❌ Wastewater seepage → contaminates drinking water.

### **C. Environmental Impact**

❌ Pollutes soil & groundwater.
❌ Methane emission → climate change.
❌ Spreads weeds & parasites when untreated dung used directly.

## 3. Safe Waste Disposal Practices

### **Dung Management**

✅ Collect dung daily.
✅ Use for **biogas production** → clean fuel.
✅ Convert to **compost/manure** → improves soil fertility.

### **Urine & Wastewater**

✅ Channel to soak pits or biogas slurry tanks.
✅ Avoid open stagnant pools.

### **Dead Animals & Biological Waste**

✅ Deep burial with lime OR incineration.
✅ Do not leave carcasses in open fields (attracts dogs, vultures, spreads disease).

### **Biomedical Waste**

✅ Dispose syringes, bottles in sealed containers.
✅ Hand over to vet or authorized disposal unit.

## 4. Farmer Hygiene During Waste Handling

✅ Wear gloves, boots, masks while handling dung/urine.
✅ Wash hands thoroughly with soap afterwards.
✅ Keep children away from waste areas.

## 5. Andhra Pradesh Perspective

* In AP, **poor waste disposal** leads to **high tick, fly, and worm infestations** in many villages.
* Govt. & APDDCF promote:
  ✅ **Biogas plants** at farm level (subsidy support).
  ✅ **Clean Milk Production schemes** for waste-water management.
  ✅ Awareness on **safe carcass disposal** to prevent disease outbreaks.

---

## ✅ Summary – Day 84

* Poor waste disposal = **disease risk for cows + humans + environment pollution**.
* Key hazards: mastitis, diarrhea, zoonotic diseases, foul odor, water contamination.
* Solutions: **biogas, composting, soak pits, proper carcass disposal, safe biomedical handling**.
* In AP: Govt. encourages **biogas & hygienic manure use**.
