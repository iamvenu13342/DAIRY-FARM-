<H1>🐄 Day 82: Biosecurity Protocols.</H1>

Biosecurity = **all the steps taken to prevent entry & spread of diseases** in a dairy farm.


---

## 1. What is Biosecurity?

* A set of **preventive measures** to protect dairy animals from diseases.
* Focuses on **keeping diseases out** (external biosecurity) and **controlling spread within farm** (internal biosecurity).
* Saves money, improves milk yield, and ensures safe milk.

---

## 2. Goals of Biosecurity

✅ Prevent entry of new diseases into farm.
✅ Reduce spread of diseases between animals.
✅ Protect human health (zoonotic diseases like Brucellosis, TB).
✅ Improve animal welfare & farm profits.

## 3. Key Biosecurity Protocols

### **A. Animal Movement Control**

* Quarantine new animals for **2–4 weeks** before joining herd.
* Avoid buying animals from unknown/unverified sources.
* Restrict farm visitors & vehicles.

### **B. Farm Entry Protocols**

* Provide **footbath with disinfectant** at shed entrance.
* Visitors & workers should **wash hands, wear clean footwear/clothes**.
* Workers should handle **sick animals last** to prevent spread.

### **C. Housing & Hygiene**

* Daily cleaning of sheds, water troughs, and feeding equipment.
* Disinfect sheds regularly.
* Proper drainage & waste disposal.
* Good ventilation & dry bedding.

### **D. Health Management**

* Follow **vaccination & deworming schedules** strictly.
* Regular veterinary check-ups.
* Isolate sick animals immediately.
* Record all disease cases & treatments.

### **E. Feed & Water Safety**

* Use **clean water** (no stagnant pond water).
* Store fodder & feed in dry, clean rooms (avoid fungal contamination).
* Don’t feed spoiled silage or mouldy grains.

### **F. Worker & Equipment Hygiene**

* Use **separate equipment** for sick animals.
* Workers should wash hands after handling each group.
* Provide **protective gear** (gloves, boots) for workers.

## 4. Emergency Disease Protocols

* Report **sudden deaths or outbreaks** (FMD, LSD, HS, BQ) to vet immediately.
* Stop visitors and animal movement during outbreaks.
* Follow govt. guidelines for vaccination & control measures.

---

## 5. Andhra Pradesh Perspective

* AP is a **high milk-producing state** with large cattle movement.
* Govt. promotes:
  ✅ **Quarantine pens** in farms.
  ✅ **Mass vaccination drives** under NADCP (FMD, Brucellosis).
  ✅ **Awareness programs** for farmers on hygiene & disease prevention.
* Special focus on **FMD & LSD control** through strict biosecurity.

---

## ✅ Summary – Day 82

* Biosecurity = **keeping diseases out + controlling spread inside farm**.
* Protocols: **quarantine, farm hygiene, vaccination, clean feed & water, worker hygiene**.
* Saves herd from deadly outbreaks & improves productivity.
* In AP: Govt. supports biosecurity via **vaccination drives & awareness campaigns**.

👉 Would you like me to also **create a Biosecurity Flowchart (Outside → Quarantine → Farm Entry → Herd Health → Waste Management → Milk Safety)** for your dairy project notes?
