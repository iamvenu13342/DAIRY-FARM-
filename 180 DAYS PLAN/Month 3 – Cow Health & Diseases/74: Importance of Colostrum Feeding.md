Colostrum is called the **“first vaccine”** for calves and is critical for survival, immunity, and growth.

## 1. What is Colostrum?

* The **first milk** secreted by the cow immediately after calving.
* Thick, yellowish, nutrient-rich liquid.
* Contains **antibodies (immunoglobulins), proteins, vitamins, minerals, and energy**.

## 2. Why is Colostrum Important?

### **A. Immunity**

* Calves are **born without antibodies**.
* Colostrum provides **passive immunity** (disease protection).
* Protects against **scours, pneumonia, and early calf diseases**.

### **B. Nutrition**

* Rich in **protein, fat, vitamins A, D, E, minerals (Ca, P, Mg)**.
* Provides energy for body warmth & activity.

### **C. Growth & Survival**

* Helps calf stand and suckle quickly.
* Reduces mortality rate in first 2 months.
* Builds strong base for future milk production.

## 3. Golden Rules of Colostrum Feeding

✅ **Time is critical** – feed colostrum **within 2 hours of birth** (gut absorbs antibodies best).
✅ **Quantity** – 10% of calf’s body weight in first 24 hours (e.g., 3–4 liters for a 30–35 kg calf).
✅ **Frequency** – 2–3 feedings in first day.
✅ **Quality** – use colostrum from **healthy, disease-free cows** (no mastitis, no Brucellosis).
✅ **Hygiene** – clean hands, bucket, and nipple before feeding.
✅ **Storage** – if excess, store in fridge/freezer (can be kept for 1 week refrigerated, 6 months frozen).

## 4. Colostrum Banking

* Collect extra colostrum from high-yielding cows.
* Store in clean bottles or plastic bags.
* Label with **cow ID & date**.
* Use when another cow gives poor/no colostrum.

## 5. Andhra Pradesh Perspective

* In AP, many small farmers **delay colostrum feeding**, leading to calf deaths.
* Govt. & APDDCF awareness programs stress:
  ✅ Early colostrum feeding within 2 hours.
  ✅ Use of **colostrum banks** in organized farms.
  ✅ Hygienic calf management.

## ✅ Summary – Day 74

* Colostrum = **first vaccine + first food**.
* Provides **immunity, nutrition, growth, and survival**.
* Must be fed **within 2 hours of birth, 10% body weight in first 24 hours**.
* In AP: awareness needed to avoid delayed or skipped colostrum feeding.
