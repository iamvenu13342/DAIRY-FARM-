<H1> 🐄 Day 81: Common Calf Care Mistakes.</H1>

Calves are the **future milk producers**, and small mistakes in early care can lead to **disease, stunted growth, and economic loss**.



---

## 1. Delayed Colostrum Feeding

❌ Many farmers delay feeding colostrum after birth.

* Result: Calf misses antibodies → weak immunity, scours, pneumonia.
  ✅ **Correct practice:** Feed colostrum **within 2 hours of birth**, 10% of body weight in first 24 hrs.

---

## 2. Poor Navel Care

❌ Navel cord left untreated → infection entry point.

* Leads to joint ill, septicemia, death.
  ✅ **Correct practice:** Dip navel cord in **iodine solution** immediately after birth.

---

## 3. Unhygienic Feeding Practices

❌ Feeding milk in dirty buckets/bottles.

* Causes calf diarrhea (scours).
  ✅ **Correct practice:** Wash and disinfect all feeding equipment daily.

---

## 4. Irregular or Improper Feeding

❌ Overfeeding milk → scours.
❌ Underfeeding → weak, stunted calves.
✅ **Correct practice:** Feed milk at **10% of body weight/day**, then gradually introduce calf starter and green fodder.

---

## 5. Poor Housing Conditions

❌ Calves kept in dark, damp, or overcrowded sheds.

* Causes pneumonia, lice infestation, stress.
  ✅ **Correct practice:** Provide **clean, dry, well-ventilated calf pens** with good bedding.

---

## 6. Neglecting Deworming & Vaccination

❌ Skipping or delaying deworming/vaccines.

* Leads to worms, stunted growth, and disease outbreaks.
  ✅ **Correct practice:**
* Deworm from 1 month of age, every 2–3 months.
* Start vaccination from 3–4 months (FMD, HS, BQ, Brucellosis in females).

---

## 7. Ignoring Growth Monitoring

❌ Farmers don’t track calf weight or body condition.

* Result: Slow growth → late maturity, poor milk yield in future.
  ✅ **Correct practice:** Weigh calves monthly, keep **growth records**.

---

## 8. Early Weaning or No Calf Starter

❌ Relying only on milk without introducing calf starter.

* Leads to poor rumen development.
  ✅ **Correct practice:** Introduce **calf starter feed by 2 weeks of age**.

---

## 9. Not Handling Calves Gently

❌ Rough handling during feeding or dehorning.

* Causes stress, fear, poor growth.
  ✅ **Correct practice:** Handle calves calmly, make them familiar with humans.

## 10. Andhra Pradesh Perspective

* Common mistakes in AP:

  * Delayed colostrum feeding.
  * Unhygienic milk feeding → calf scours outbreaks.
  * Lack of deworming/vaccination in smallholder farms.
* APDDCF & AHD conduct **calf rearing awareness programs** to reduce calf mortality.

---

## ✅ Summary – Day 81

* Common calf care mistakes: **delayed colostrum, poor navel care, dirty feeding, over/underfeeding, poor housing, no vaccination, neglecting growth**.
* Corrective actions: **timely colostrum, hygiene, proper feeding, good housing, regular deworming/vaccination, growth monitoring**.
* In AP: Govt. awareness needed to reduce calf mortality & improve dairy productivity.
