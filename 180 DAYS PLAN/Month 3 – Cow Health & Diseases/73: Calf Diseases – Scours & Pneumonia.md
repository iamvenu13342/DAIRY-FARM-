<H1>🐄 Day 73: Calf Diseases – Scours & Pneumonia.</H1>

Calves are the **future of a dairy farm**, but they are highly vulnerable to diseases in the first few months.

## 1. Importance of Calf Health

* Calves are **foundation stock** for future milk yield.
* Diseases in calves → **high mortality, poor growth, weak immunity, infertility later**.
* Two most common killer diseases: **Scours (diarrhea)** and **Pneumonia**.

## 2. Scours (Calf Diarrhea)

### **Causes**

* Infectious: **E. coli, Rotavirus, Coronavirus, Salmonella, Coccidia**.
* Non-infectious: Poor colostrum feeding, unclean milk, dirty housing, overfeeding.

### **Symptoms**

⚠️ Watery, foul-smelling diarrhea (yellow, white, or blood-stained).
⚠️ Dehydration → sunken eyes, dry nose, skin folds.
⚠️ Weakness, loss of appetite.
⚠️ In severe cases → death in 1–2 days if untreated.

### **Prevention**

✅ Feed **colostrum within 2 hours of birth** (immunity).
✅ Keep milk bottles, buckets, and nipples **clean**.
✅ Provide clean water.
✅ Avoid sudden diet changes.
✅ Vaccinate cows against scours-causing agents (e.g., rotavirus, E. coli) during late pregnancy.

## 3. Pneumonia (Respiratory Disease)

### **Causes**

* Infectious: **Pasteurella, Mycoplasma, viruses**.
* Non-infectious: Sudden cold, poor ventilation, overcrowding, damp bedding.

### **Symptoms**

⚠️ Coughing, nasal discharge (white/yellow).
⚠️ Fever, fast breathing.
⚠️ Drooping ears, dullness.
⚠️ Reduced appetite, poor growth.
⚠️ Untreated cases → death or stunted growth.

### **Prevention**

✅ Provide **warm, dry, well-ventilated housing** (avoid draughts).
✅ Do not overcrowd calf pens.
✅ Provide clean, dry bedding.
✅ Vaccination against respiratory diseases (HS, Pasteurella) where advised.
✅ Ensure good colostrum feeding to boost immunity.

## 4. First Aid & Management

* **Scours:** Immediate oral rehydration solution (ORS), electrolytes. Call vet for antibiotics if infection suspected.
* **Pneumonia:** Keep calf warm, consult vet for antibiotics & supportive care.
* **Golden Rule:** **Quick response saves calves**. Delay leads to death.

## 5. Andhra Pradesh Perspective

* **Scours** → very common in coastal humid areas (due to dirty housing & wet conditions).
* **Pneumonia** → higher in **winter & monsoon** (cold + damp sheds).
* Govt. & APDDCF focus on **colostrum awareness, clean calf pens, deworming & vaccination**.

---

## ✅ Summary – Day 73

* Scours = calf diarrhea → dehydration, death if untreated.
* Pneumonia = respiratory infection → cough, fever, poor growth.
* Prevention: **colostrum, hygiene, dry bedding, good ventilation, vaccination**.
* In AP: **scours & pneumonia major calf killers**, preventable with **clean management & early care**.
