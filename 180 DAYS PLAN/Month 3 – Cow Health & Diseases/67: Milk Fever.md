<H1> üêÑ Day 67: Milk Fever.</H1>

Milk fever is a **metabolic disease** that occurs mostly in **high-yielding cows around calving**.


---

## 1. What is Milk Fever?

* A **metabolic disorder** caused by **low blood calcium (hypocalcemia)**.
* Happens usually **within 2‚Äì3 days after calving**.
* Common in **high-yielding crossbreds (HF, Jersey)**.

---

## 2. Why Does It Happen?

* At calving, sudden demand for **calcium in milk**.
* If body cannot mobilize enough calcium ‚Üí blood calcium drops.
* Muscles & nerves cannot function properly.

## 3. Symptoms of Milk Fever

### **Early Signs (Stage 1)**

‚ö†Ô∏è Restlessness, loss of appetite.
‚ö†Ô∏è Muscle tremors (shivering).
‚ö†Ô∏è Unsteady walking, stiff legs.

### **Moderate Signs (Stage 2)**

‚ö†Ô∏è Cow unable to stand, sits with head bent to flank.
‚ö†Ô∏è Cold ears & nose.
‚ö†Ô∏è Weak pulse, low body temperature.

### **Severe Signs (Stage 3)**

‚ö†Ô∏è Cow lies flat on side, unconscious.
‚ö†Ô∏è Can die within 12‚Äì24 hours if untreated.

## 4. Risk Factors

* High-yielding dairy breeds (HF, Jersey).
* Older cows (3rd lactation onwards).
* Cows with history of milk fever.
* Feeding **high-calcium diet before calving** (prevents calcium mobilization).

---

## 5. Prevention

‚úÖ **Pre-calving diet management**

* Feed **low-calcium diet** 2‚Äì3 weeks before calving ‚Üí stimulates calcium mobilization.
* Provide balanced **mineral mixture (Ca\:P ratio 2:1)**.

‚úÖ **Vitamin D supplementation**

* Helps calcium absorption.

‚úÖ **Avoid sudden diet changes** before and after calving.

‚úÖ **Oral calcium gel/bolus**

* Give **immediately at calving and 12 hours later** in high-risk cows.

---

## 6. Treatment (Veterinarian Required)

* IV injection of **calcium borogluconate** (slowly).
* Oral calcium supplements after recovery.
* Nursing care: keep cow warm, turn sides every few hours if down.

---

## 7. Andhra Pradesh Perspective

* Milk fever is **increasing in crossbred HF/Jersey cows** in AP.
* More common in **intensive dairy farms** with high-yield cows.
* AP Animal Husbandry Dept. advises:
  ‚úÖ Proper **mineral mixture feeding**.
  ‚úÖ Avoid high-calcium feeding pre-calving.
  ‚úÖ Keep **calcium gel/bolus ready at calving time**.

---

## ‚úÖ Summary ‚Äì Day 67

* Milk fever = **low calcium after calving** ‚Üí muscle weakness, inability to stand, death if untreated.
* Symptoms: tremors ‚Üí downer cow ‚Üí unconscious.
* Prevention: **low-calcium diet pre-calving, oral calcium at calving, mineral mix**.
* Treatment: **IV calcium by vet + oral supplements**.
* In AP: rising cases in **crossbreds**, requires farmer awareness & preventive feeding.
