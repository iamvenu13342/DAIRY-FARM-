<H1> 🐄 Day 69: Parasites – Ticks & Worms.</H1>

Parasites are a **hidden cause of reduced milk yield, poor growth, and disease spread** in cattle.


---

## 1. What are Parasites?

* Organisms that **live on or inside cows**, taking nutrients and causing harm.
* Two major groups in dairy farming:
  🟤 **External parasites** → ticks, lice, flies.
  ⚪ **Internal parasites** → worms (roundworms, tapeworms, liver flukes).

---

## 2. Tick Infestation

### **Effects of Ticks**

⚠️ Suck blood → weakness, anemia.
⚠️ Cause irritation, itching, skin damage.
⚠️ Spread serious diseases → **Babesiosis, Theileriosis, Anaplasmosis**.
⚠️ Reduce milk yield & fertility.

### **Prevention & Control**

✅ Regular **spraying/dipping with acaricides** (cypermethrin, deltamethrin).
✅ Maintain clean, dry sheds.
✅ Remove bushes & weeds near farm.
✅ Rotate chemicals to prevent resistance.
✅ Treat all animals in herd at once.

---

## 3. Worm Infestation

### **Types of Worms**

* **Roundworms (Gastrointestinal worms):** Cause diarrhea, poor growth.
* **Tapeworms:** Reduce digestion efficiency.
* **Liver flukes:** Damage liver → weakness, weight loss, bottle jaw (swelling under jaw).

### **Effects of Worms**

⚠️ Poor growth in calves & heifers.
⚠️ Loss of appetite, diarrhea, anemia.
⚠️ Reduced feed efficiency → less milk.
⚠️ Infertility in chronic cases.

### **Prevention & Control**

✅ **Deworming every 3–6 months** with broad-spectrum anthelmintics (albendazole, fenbendazole, ivermectin).
✅ Rotate deworming drugs to avoid resistance.
✅ Avoid grazing on wet marshy land (fluke-prone).
✅ Keep sheds clean, remove dung regularly.
✅ Provide balanced nutrition for immunity.

## 4. Economic Impact

* Parasites cause **huge hidden losses**:
  ❌ Milk yield drop (10–20%).
  ❌ Poor calf growth.
  ❌ Increased disease spread.
  ❌ High treatment costs.

---

## 5. Andhra Pradesh Perspective

* **Ticks:** Common in **humid coastal & Rayalaseema regions** → spread of **tick fever**.
* **Liver flukes:** Found in **paddy-growing districts (Krishna, Godavari)** due to wet fields.
* Govt. of AP conducts **deworming and tick control drives** under livestock health schemes.
* Farmers advised to **follow herd deworming calendar** + shed sanitation.

---

## ✅ Summary – Day 69

* Parasites = **external (ticks) & internal (worms)**.
* Ticks → anemia, skin damage, tick fever.
* Worms → poor growth, diarrhea, liver damage.
* Control: **acaricide spraying + deworming every 3–6 months + hygiene**.
* In AP: tick fever & liver fluke are major concerns.

Perfect 👍 Let’s design a **Parasite Control Calendar** for your dairy project notes.
This will be a **simple, farmer-friendly schedule** that covers both **internal parasites (worms)** and **external parasites (ticks/lice)**.

# 🐄 Parasite Control Calendar (Dairy Cows)

---

## 1. Internal Parasite Control (Deworming)

✅ **Every 3 months (Quarterly Deworming)**

* **January, April, July, October** → Broad-spectrum dewormer (Albendazole/Fenbendazole).
* **Special note:**

  * Pregnant cows → deworm in **early pregnancy**, avoid last trimester.
  * Calves (1–6 months) → deworm at **monthly/bi-monthly intervals** initially.

⚠️ Rotate drugs (Albendazole → Fenbendazole → Ivermectin) to prevent resistance.

---

## 2. External Parasite Control (Ticks, Lice, Flies)

✅ **Monthly / Bi-monthly Spraying or Pour-on**

* **Tick season (Hot & Humid months – March to October):** Spray every **3–4 weeks**.

* **Cool season (November to February):** Spray every **6–8 weeks**.

* Use acaricides: **Cypermethrin, Deltamethrin, Amitraz** (rotate to avoid resistance).

* Spray/dip **all animals together**.

* Also spray **shed walls, floor, and surroundings**.

---

## 3. Shed & Hygiene Calendar

* **Daily:** Remove dung, clean water troughs.
* **Weekly:** Spray disinfectant in shed.
* **Monthly:** Remove weeds & bushes near cattle shed (tick breeding ground).

---

## 4. Andhra Pradesh Adaptation

* **Coastal AP (humid):** Tick control every **3 weeks**.
* **Rayalaseema (dry):** Tick control every **4–6 weeks**.
* **Paddy areas (Krishna, Godavari):** Extra focus on **liver fluke deworming** after monsoon.

## ✅ Sample Yearly Calendar (Summary)

| Month     | Deworming (Worms) | Tick/Parasite Control (Spray/Dip) |
| --------- | ----------------- | --------------------------------- |
| January   | ✅ Deworming       | Spray (every 6–8 weeks)           |
| February  | —                 | Spray                             |
| March     | —                 | Spray (start of tick season)      |
| April     | ✅ Deworming       | Spray                             |
| May       | —                 | Spray                             |
| June      | —                 | Spray                             |
| July      | ✅ Deworming       | Spray                             |
| August    | —                 | Spray                             |
| September | —                 | Spray                             |
| October   | ✅ Deworming       | Spray                             |
| November  | —                 | Spray (reduce frequency)          |
| December  | —                 | Spray (if needed)                 |

## ✅ Summary – Parasite Control Calendar

* Deworming → **Quarterly (4 times/year)**.
* Tick control → **Monthly in summer/monsoon, once in 2 months in winter**.
* Hygiene → **Daily cleaning, monthly surroundings maintenance**.
* AP-specific → **focus on tick fever (coastal/Rayalaseema) & liver fluke (paddy areas)**.
