<H1> üêÑ Day 68: Ketosis IN A DAIRY COWS .</H1>

Ketosis is a **common metabolic disease** seen in **high-yielding dairy cows after calving**.


---

## 1. What is Ketosis?

* A **metabolic disorder** caused by **negative energy balance**.
* Happens when **cow‚Äôs energy demand for milk > energy intake from feed**.
* Body burns fat for energy ‚Üí produces **ketone bodies** (toxic in excess).
* Usually occurs **2‚Äì6 weeks after calving**.

---

## 2. Causes

* High milk production with poor feeding.
* Reduced feed intake after calving (stress, illness).
* Sudden change from pregnancy diet to lactation diet.
* Obesity in cows before calving.

---

## 3. Symptoms

### **General Signs**

‚ö†Ô∏è Loss of appetite (especially concentrates).
‚ö†Ô∏è Rapid weight loss.
‚ö†Ô∏è Drop in milk yield.
‚ö†Ô∏è Dullness, low activity.

### **Specific Signs**

‚ö†Ô∏è **Sweet/fruity (acetone-like) smell** in breath, milk, urine.
‚ö†Ô∏è Constipation or sometimes diarrhea.
‚ö†Ô∏è Nervous signs in severe cases (staggering, abnormal licking, head pressing).

## 4. Types of Ketosis

* **Clinical Ketosis:** Visible symptoms (milk drop, appetite loss, smell).
* **Subclinical Ketosis:** No clear signs ‚Üí detected by urine/milk/blood ketone tests.

---

## 5. Diagnosis

* Urine/milk test strips (detect ketones).
* Blood test for Œ≤-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA).
* In farms: **smell & milk drop** are main indicators.

---

## 6. Prevention

‚úÖ **Balanced Diet Before & After Calving**

* Avoid overfeeding during dry period ‚Üí prevents obesity.
* Increase energy-dense feeds (maize, grains) after calving.
* Provide good quality silage & green fodder.

‚úÖ **Use of Feed Additives**

* Propylene glycol (energy source).
* Niacin, yeast culture.

‚úÖ **Good Transition Management**

* Gradually increase concentrates before calving (steaming-up).
* Monitor body condition score (BCS).

---

## 7. Treatment (Veterinarian Required)

* IV **glucose (dextrose) solution** for quick energy.
* Oral **propylene glycol drench**.
* Vitamin B12 injections.
* Supportive feeding & nursing care.

---

## 8. Andhra Pradesh Perspective

* More cases in **high-yielding crossbreds (HF, Jersey)** in commercial farms.
* Common in **intensive farms in Krishna, Guntur, Chittoor districts**.
* AP Animal Husbandry Dept. advises:
  ‚úÖ Balanced **pre- and post-calving nutrition**.
  ‚úÖ Monitoring milk yield & appetite post-calving.
  ‚úÖ Farmers to **keep propylene glycol/glucose ready** during early lactation.

---

## ‚úÖ Summary ‚Äì Day 68

* Ketosis = **energy deficiency after calving**, excess fat breakdown ‚Üí ketones.
* Symptoms: milk drop, appetite loss, fruity smell, weight loss.
* Prevention: **balanced feeding, energy-rich diets, avoid obesity before calving**.
* Treatment: **IV glucose, propylene glycol, vitamins**.
* In AP: rising cases in crossbreds, especially in high-yield farms.
