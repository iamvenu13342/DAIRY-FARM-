<H1> 🐄 Day 85: Disease Outbreak Case Studies.</H1>

Case studies help farmers **learn from real incidents** and avoid repeating mistakes.

## 1. Case Study 1 – Foot & Mouth Disease (FMD) in Andhra Pradesh

* **Background:** A medium dairy farm in Krishna district (2021).
* **Cause:** New animal purchased without quarantine → carried FMD virus.
* **Spread:** Within 10 days, 70% herd infected.
* **Symptoms:** Mouth ulcers, lameness, high fever, sharp drop in milk.
* **Losses:** 40% milk production drop for 2 months, high treatment cost.
* **Lesson Learned:**
  ✅ Always **quarantine new animals for 3 weeks**.
  ✅ Follow **bi-annual FMD vaccination** (April, October).

## 2. Case Study 2 – Lumpy Skin Disease (LSD) Outbreak in AP (2022)

* **Background:** Outbreak in several coastal districts (West Godavari, Guntur).
* **Cause:** Virus spread through **biting flies & animal movement**.
* **Symptoms:** Fever, skin nodules, drop in milk, abortions.
* **Losses:** Mortality ~5%, milk yield dropped 20–30%, calf losses.
* **Control:** Mass vaccination drive + vector control (fly sprays).
* **Lesson Learned:**
  ✅ Vaccinate against LSD annually.
  ✅ Control flies & mosquitoes.
  ✅ Restrict animal movement during outbreaks.

## 3. Case Study 3 – Mastitis in Commercial Farm (Chittoor District)

* **Background:** High-yielding HF cows in an organized farm (2019).
* **Cause:** Poor milking hygiene, dirty bedding, untreated subclinical mastitis.
* **Symptoms:** Swollen udder, clotted milk, reduced yield.
* **Losses:** 25% milk loss, vet bills, discarded milk (antibiotic residue).
* **Lesson Learned:**
  ✅ Maintain **milking hygiene** (teat dipping, clean machines).
  ✅ Regular **milk testing** (California Mastitis Test).
  ✅ Improve **shed cleanliness & bedding**.

## 4. Case Study 4 – Calf Scours (Diarrhea) in Smallholder Farm

* **Background:** 10-cow farm in Rayalaseema (2020).
* **Cause:** Delayed colostrum feeding + feeding milk in dirty buckets.
* **Symptoms:** Diarrhea, dehydration, calf deaths.
* **Losses:** 50% calves died, farmer lost future milk-producing stock.
* **Lesson Learned:**
  ✅ Feed **colostrum within 2 hrs of birth**.
  ✅ Maintain feeding hygiene.
  ✅ Keep **ORS & electrolytes** ready for calf care.

## 5. Case Study 5 – Brucellosis in Crossbred Cows

* **Background:** Semi-commercial farm in Guntur (2018).
* **Cause:** Lack of Brucellosis vaccination in heifers.
* **Symptoms:** Abortions at 6–8 months pregnancy, infertility.
* **Losses:** 30% cows became infertile, economic loss in replacement cost.
* **Lesson Learned:**
  ✅ Vaccinate all **female calves (6–8 months)** with Brucella S19.
  ✅ Avoid buying untested animals.
  ✅ Maintain **biosecurity & records**.

---

## ✅ Summary – Day 85

* **FMD:** uncontrolled new entry → heavy milk loss.
* **LSD:** vector-borne disease → vaccination & fly control essential.
* **Mastitis:** poor hygiene → maintain clean milking practices.
* **Scours:** calf mortality → early colostrum & hygiene needed.
* **Brucellosis:** abortion storms → vaccinate female calves.

👉 Lessons: **quarantine, vaccination, hygiene, record keeping, biosecurity** are the backbone of disease prevention.

👉 Would you like me to also **design a comparison table (Disease → Cause → Loss → Lesson Learned)** for these case studies, so farmers can revise quickly?
