<H1> 🐄 Day 70: De-worming Schedule.</H1>

A proper de-worming schedule ensures **healthy digestion, better feed efficiency, and higher milk yield**.



---

## 1. Why De-worming is Important

* Internal parasites (roundworms, liver flukes, tapeworms) cause:
  ❌ Poor growth in calves.
  ❌ Weight loss & anemia.
  ❌ Low milk yield & infertility.
  ❌ Weak immunity → more disease risk.
* Regular de-worming = **healthy herd + more profit**.

## 2. General De-worming Guidelines

### **A. Calves**

* **First dose:** At **1 month of age**.
* Then every **2–3 months** till 1 year.
* Use mild dewormers (Albendazole/Fenbendazole).

### **B. Heifers (1–2 years)**

* Every **3 months**.
* Focus on roundworms & tapeworms.

### **C. Adult Cows & Buffaloes**

* **Quarterly (every 3 months)**.
* Special focus: **pre-calving & post-monsoon**.
* Liver fluke control important in **paddy areas**.

## 3. Seasonal Deworming

✅ **Pre-Monsoon (June):** To reduce worm load before rainy season.
✅ **Post-Monsoon (September–October):** High worm & fluke risk → compulsory deworming.
✅ **Winter (January):** Routine dose.
✅ **Summer (April–May):** Routine dose.

---

## 4. Drugs Commonly Used

* **Albendazole** → broad-spectrum, also kills flukes (higher dose).
* **Fenbendazole** → safe for calves.
* **Ivermectin** → kills worms + external parasites (ticks, lice).
* **Closantel/Triclabendazole** → special for liver flukes.

⚠️ Always rotate drugs to avoid resistance.

---

## 5. Special Considerations

* **Pregnant Cows:** Avoid deworming in **last trimester**.
* **Weak or sick animals:** Deworm after recovery.
* **After Deworming:** Provide good feed + minerals to support recovery.

---

## 6. Andhra Pradesh Perspective

* **Coastal AP (paddy regions – Krishna, Godavari):** Liver fluke common → extra deworming after monsoon.
* **Rayalaseema (dry regions):** Roundworms & tapeworms more common.
* **APDDCF & AHD** conduct **mass deworming drives** every 6 months in villages.

## ✅ Example Annual De-worming Schedule (Adults)

| Month       | Action                                   |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **January** | Deworming (general worms)                |
| **April**   | Deworming (general worms)                |
| **July**    | Deworming (rainy season worms)           |
| **October** | Deworming (liver flukes + general worms) |

---

## ✅ Summary – Day 70

* De-worming = **key to herd health & milk production**.
* Calves → start at 1 month, repeat every 2–3 months.
* Adults → **every 3 months** (quarterly).
* Seasonal → focus on **pre- and post-monsoon**.
* In AP: **extra care for liver flukes in coastal districts**.
