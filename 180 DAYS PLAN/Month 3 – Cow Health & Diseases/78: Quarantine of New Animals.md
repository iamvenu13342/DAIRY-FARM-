## 2. Why Quarantine is Important

✅ Prevents spread of infectious diseases (FMD, LSD, Brucellosis, Mastitis).
✅ Helps detect **hidden/subclinical diseases**.
✅ Allows time for **vaccination & deworming** before mixing.
✅ Saves herd from **economic losses due to outbreaks**.

## 3. Quarantine Procedure

### **Step 1 – Isolation**

* Keep new animals in a **separate shed/paddock** at least 500 m away from main herd.

### **Step 2 – Health Check**

* Veterinary check-up on arrival.
* Screen for diseases (Brucellosis, TB, Mastitis).
* Record animal’s health, vaccination, and deworming history.

### **Step 3 – Preventive Care**
