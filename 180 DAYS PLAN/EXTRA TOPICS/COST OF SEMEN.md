The cost of semen (AI dose) in cows in India varies depending on the type (conventional vs sexed), the breed, whether it's indigenous or imported, whether there's subsidy, etc. Here are recent data and a breakdown to give you an idea:

## üí° Current Prices / Examples in India

| Type / Source                                              | Approx Price / Dose                                                                                                                               |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Indigenous conventional semen** (local bulls)            | \~ **Rs 20-30** per dose in some government labs. ([The Times of India][1])                                                                       |
| **Imported-breed conventional semen**                      | Higher, e.g. Genus ABS India offers some conventional semen at **Rs 599** per straw. ([Genus ABS India][2])                                       |
| **Sex-sorted / sexed semen** (to get mostly female calves) | Much more expensive; in some cases **Rs 750 - 1,200** per dose. ([The Indian Express][3])                                                         |
| **Government subsidised rate**                             | After subsidy, farmers may pay less; e.g. govt of Assam sells frozen semen with accessories at **Rs 50** per dose. ([veterinary.assam.gov.in][4]) |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Factors Influencing Semen Price

Here are things that make certain semen doses cost more or less:

1. **Breed / Genetics**

   * Semen from high-genetic merit bulls (good milk yield, health traits) is costlier.
   * Imported or exotic breeds more expensive than indigenous ones.

2. **Sexed vs Conventional Semen**

   * Sexed (to produce female calves) has sorting technology, lower concentration, often lower conception rates ‚Üí higher cost.

3. **Source / Production Method**

   * Government labs usually charge lower (with subsidies).
   * Private companies / imported semen cost more.

4. **Subsidies / Policy Support**

   * Many states or central govt schemes subsidize AI / semen cost to encourage use. That reduces what the farmer pays.

5. **Handling & Transportation / Cold Chain**

   * Frozen semen needs good storage, cold chain, transport, expert technicians. These raise cost.

6. **Supply & Demand / Availability**

   * In remote areas fewer facilities ‚Üí higher delivery cost.
   * If demand is low, unit cost may be higher.

## ‚úÖ What This Means for a Farmer

* If you use **local bulls / indigenous conventional semen** and access govt labs, you might pay very little (Rs 20-50) per dose.
* If you want better genetics or sexed semen you‚Äôll pay significantly more (several hundred rupees).
* Always check whether subsidy is available in your district ‚Äî it can drastically drop your cost.

If you like, I can check **semen cost in your specific region (near Rayleigh, but probably India region you mean?)** so you have a really local number. Do you want that?
