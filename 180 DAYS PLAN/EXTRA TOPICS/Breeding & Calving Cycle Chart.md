Perfect ✅ Let’s make a **Breeding & Calving Cycle Chart** for a dairy cow. This will show the full cycle from birth, first heat, breeding, calving, and when to start the next pregnancy.

# 🐄 Breeding & Calving Cycle Chart

| **Stage**                                        | **Timeline**                      | **Details**                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Birth of Heifer Calf**                         | Day 0                             | Female calf born                                                                 |
| **Puberty (First Heat)**                         | 8–12 months                       | Heifer shows first estrus (not ready for breeding yet)                           |
| **Breeding Age (Maturity)**                      | 15–18 months                      | Heifer reaches 40–50% of adult weight → ready for first breeding (AI or natural) |
| **Gestation Period**                             | 283 days (\~9.5 months)           | Pregnancy duration                                                               |
| **First Calving (Becomes Cow)**                  | \~24–27 months (2–2.3 years)      | Heifer gives birth to her first calf                                             |
| **Lactation (Milking Period)**                   | From calving until \~305 days     | Peak milk yield at 40–60 days postpartum                                         |
| **Postpartum Estrus (First Heat After Calving)** | 30–60 days after calving          | First heat returns but not ideal for breeding                                    |
| **Breeding Back (Re-insemination)**              | 60–90 days after calving          | Best time to get cow pregnant again                                              |
| **Dry Period**                                   | Last 60 days of pregnancy         | Stop milking → allow udder rest & calf growth                                    |
| **Next Calving**                                 | \~12–13 months after last calving | Cycle repeats → target calving interval                                          |

## 📌 Key Management Targets for Dairy Farm

* **Heifer age at first calving:** 24–27 months
* **Calving interval (calving-to-calving):** 12–13 months
* **Dry period:** 60 days before calving
* **Service period (calving to next conception):** 60–90 days

---

✅ **Summary:**

* Heifer breeds at 15–18 months → calves at \~2 years old
* Gestation = \~283 days
* Next pregnancy should start \~2–3 months after calving
* Goal: **1 calf per cow per year**

👉 Do you want me to also design a **visual timeline/diagram** (like a flowchart or calendar view) for this cycle so it’s easier to present in your dairy farm project plan?
