### 2. Andhra Pradesh Pollution Control Board (APPCB) Requirements
Dairy farms generate waste (e.g., cow dung, wastewater), requiring environmental clearances from the APPCB to prevent pollution.

- **Consent to Establish (CTE)**:
  - Apply for a CTE before starting construction of the dairy farm to ensure environmental compliance.
  - **Application Process**:
    - Visit the APPCB online portal (https://pcb.ap.gov.in) and register.
    - Submit an application for CTE with:
      - Detailed project report (DPR) of the dairy farm.
      - Layout plan showing waste management systems (e.g., biogas plant, composting area).
      - Water sources and effluent treatment plans.
      - Environmental impact assessment (if required for larger farms).
    - Pay the applicable fees online (typically ₹1,000–₹10,000 for small farms).
    - The APPCB may inspect the site to verify compliance.
  - **Timeline**: Approval takes 25–35 working days.

- **Consent to Operate (CTO)**:
  - After construction, apply for a CTO to start operations.
  - **Documents Required**:
    - Factory layout and waste management plan.
    - Details of effluent treatment and emissions control.
    - Compliance report for CTE conditions.
    - Hazardous waste management plan (if applicable, under the Hazardous & Other Waste Rules, 2016).
  - **Renewal**: The CTO is valid for 1–10 years (depending on the farm’s scale) and must be renewed.
  - **Timeline**: Approval takes 25–35 working days.

- **Waste Management**:
  - For a farm with <100 desi cows producing organic fertilizer:
    - **Biogas Plant**: Convert cow dung into biogas and use slurry as manure. This reduces pollution and may qualify for subsidies under schemes like **GOBAR-DHAN**.
    - **Composting**: Set up vermicomposting or other composting units for organic fertilizer production.
    - Ensure no untreated waste is discharged into water bodies or open land, per the **Water Act, 1974**, and **Air Act, 1981**.
  - **Category**: Small dairy farms are typically classified under the **Green or Orange category** by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), with less stringent requirements for farms with <100 cows.

- **Groundwater Usage**:
  - If using groundwater (e.g., borewells), obtain a No-Objection Certificate (NOC) from the Andhra Pradesh State Ground Water Regulatory Authority or Central Ground Water Authority (CGWA) before drilling.

### 3. Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) Registration
Since the farm will produce milk and possibly milk-based products (e.g., ghee, curd), FSSAI registration is mandatory for food safety compliance.

- **Type of FSSAI License**:
  - **Basic Registration**: Suitable for small dairy farms with an annual turnover below ₹12 lakh. Likely applicable for a farm in Palapadu with <100 cows and limited milk production.
  - **State License**: Required for medium-scale farms with an annual turnover of ₹12 lakh–₹20 crore, or if processing milk products commercially.
  - **Central License**: For large-scale farms with turnover >₹20 crore or multi-state operations (unlikely for Palapadu unless scaling significantly).

- **Dairy-Specific Thresholds**:
  - A dairy unit handling >**50,000 liters of liquid milk/day** or **2,500 MT of milk solids/year** requires a State or Central License. For <100 cows, Basic Registration is typically sufficient unless production exceeds these limits.

- **Application Process**:
  - **Online Application**:
    - Visit the FSSAI Food Licensing and Registration System (FLRS) portal (https://foodlicensing.fssai.gov.in).
    - Select Andhra Pradesh and fill out Form A (Basic Registration) or Form B (State/Central License).
    - Upload documents:
      - Identity and address proof of the applicant.
      - Layout plan of the processing unit (if applicable).
      - List of food products (e.g., milk, ghee, curd).
      - Water quality test report for water used in processing.
      - NOC from Gram Panchayat or APPCB (if required).
