<h1>Capital Investment Estimation Land, cows, shed, machinery, feed, labor, insurance</h1>

Estimating the capital investment for a cow dairy farm in Palapadu village, Palnadu district, Andhra Pradesh, involves analyzing costs for land, cows, shed construction, machinery, feed, labor, insurance, and other operational expenses. The following estimation is tailored for a small-scale dairy farm with **50 desi cows** (e.g., breeds like Sahiwal, Gir, or Deoni), focusing on milk production and organic fertilizer (e.g., vermicompost, Ghana Jeevamrutham), based on general market rates in Andhra Pradesh, available web resources, and typical dairy farming practices in India. Costs are approximate and may vary depending on local conditions, inflation, and specific farm design. All costs are in Indian Rupees (₹) as of 2025, adjusted for Andhra Pradesh’s rural context.
