## 🌿 Hydroponics Farming (Leafy Greens & Herbs) – Overview & Business Plan

---

### 📌 1. What is Hydroponics?

Hydroponics is a **soilless farming technique** where plants grow in a **nutrient-rich water solution**, either in vertical stacks or horizontal channels. This method enables:

* Faster growth
* Higher yields
* Minimal space & water use

---

### 🥬 2. Ideal Crops for Hydroponics

#### **Leafy Greens:**

* Lettuce (Romaine, Butterhead)
* Spinach
* Kale
* Swiss chard
* Arugula

#### **Herbs:**

* Basil
* Mint
* Parsley
* Coriander (Cilantro)
* Thyme
* Oregano

---

### 🌍 3. Market Demand

* Growing demand for **pesticide-free**, **fresh greens** in urban areas
* Hotels, restaurants, salad bars, and organic food stores are key buyers
* Ideal for **urban farming startups**, **local delivery models**, and **exports**

### 🧪 4. Farming Techniques in Hydroponics

| Method                            | Best for            | Description                                         |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **NFT (Nutrient Film Technique)** | Leafy greens        | Nutrients flow in thin film through channels        |
| **DWC (Deep Water Culture)**      | Lettuce, herbs      | Roots suspended in oxygenated water                 |
| **Ebb & Flow**                    | Herbs & leafy crops | Nutrient water floods and drains roots periodically |
| **Vertical Stacking**             | Space-saving farms  | Multiple layers of NFT/DWC for urban areas          |
