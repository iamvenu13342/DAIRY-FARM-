## ðŸŒ± Spirulina Cultivation and Processing â€“ Overview & Business Plan

---

## 1. **What is Spirulina?**

Spirulina is a blue-green algae (cyanobacteria) rich in:

* Protein (up to 60â€“70%)
* Vitamins (B1, B2, B3, B6, B12)
* Iron, calcium, antioxidants, and essential amino acids

It is grown in **alkaline water** and harvested, dried, and processed into powder, tablets, capsules, or food additives.
